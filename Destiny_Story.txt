Golden Age - According to various in-game quotes and Grimoire entries, the Golden Age lasted a few centuries. It came to a devastating end in the wake of the Collapse. 
Present Dayâ€”Humanity detects and tracks the Traveler as it enters the Sol System and terraforms Mercury, Venus, and the moons of Jupiter. When it reaches Mars, the multinational Ares One mission is launched to make contact with it. The Traveler promises humanity the universe  and imparts its vast knowledge to the species, spurring the colonization of the Solar System. 
Early Golden Age 
The Cosmodrome is built in modern-day Kazakhstan where humanity first takes to the stars in search of what lays beyond and ultimately in hope of escaping their overcrowded planet. 
The Beginning of the Golden Age The Golden Age, a centuries-long era of widespread prosperity and technological miracles, begins. 
Arrival of the Ahamkara The Ahamkara, a species with the ability to shapeshift and grant wishes, arrive in the system following the Traveler's arrival. 
The formation of the North American Empire The North American Empire is formed. 
50 years after the Traveler's discovery At the age of 90, Commander Jacob Hardy records his experiences from the Ares One mission in his diary and explains how the Traveler's dramatic impact on human well-being and civilization changed everything while studying the properties of Light-influenced terraforming. 
The Cloud Walkers lead the first Exodus. 
The First off-Earth Colony The first off-Earth colony is established in the Ocean of Storms on the Moon and an exobotany laboratory is built in Mare Cognitum. 
The foundation of Freehold The city of Freehold is founded on Mars with the support of Clovis Bray. It becomes known as one of humanity's greatest achievements. 
The Colonization of Venus The Hesperonauts first descend into Venus's boiling mists and place terraforming engines in caldaras, beginning the planet's transformation into a habitable world. They were later remembered by the Last City and the Guardians through a set of armor forged in their honor. 
The Discovery of the Vex During the initial exploration of Venus, ancient Vex ruins are discovered. Early Vex research outposts like Campus 9 attract Earth's brightest minds, leading to a colonization rush on the planet. The researchers found the Ishtar Collective and the Ishtar Academy. 
Birth of the Warmind The Clovis Bray Corporation take the code of the "R", an AI designed by M. Mihaylova and upgrade it into the sentient interplanetary defense system Rasputin. Clovis Bray I intended for him to take the Traveler's place, however Dr. Anastasia Bray goes against Clovis's orders, teaching him the different things of humanity. Rasputin goes on to rewrite Clovis's protocols, locking him out. 
A copper box with a red lid is discovered, its lid dented, one hinge shattered. Inside is a small quantity of the finest, driest powder, more brown than gray, more blue than green. The powder is weighed by the grain and studied closely. One hundred billion bits reside inside, all of them tiny and nearly spherical, and etched with the outlines of continents and islands and icecaps. Each sphere represents a planet. One is found on Earth, Mars, and Venus. Many studies presume that the box is a message of how minuscule all of creation is, and some wonder who delivered this message, and why. 
A father on Venus shows his son a representation of what their world used to look like before the Traveler arrived. 
Mid-Golden Age 
The colonization of the Asteroid Belt Human settlements are established in the Asteroid Belt, subsequently becoming a treasure trove of industry. 
The creation of Silver A currency known as Silver is developed, and is later used by the Reef post-Collapse. 
The colonization of Jupiter Jupiter and its moons become a cornerstone of human civilization, lunar cities buried deep in ice shelves and within subaqueous oceans. 
Discovery of the K1 Anomaly Miners on the Moon discover a strange artifact. The Clovis Bray corporation and the Aeronautics of China create a research site around the artifact. By studying it they learn it is an artifact of Darkness, which Clovis Bray I calls "Clarity". Clovis uses the artifact to commune with the Witness, who instructs him to make his way to Europa, with the promise of obtaining the secrets of immortality. 
Colonization of Europa Clovis and his team arrive on Europa. They found the colony Eventide and the facility, Bray Exoscience. Clovis begins his plans for the Exo Project, the project to transfer human consciousness into humanoid machines. 
Discovery of Clarity Control Clovis Bray discovers the Pyramid artifact, which he calls "Clarity Control". Clovis and his team attempt to move the artifact however this results in the death of nineteen engineers. Due to being unable to move the artifact, Clovis constructs the facility which would become known as the Deep Stone Crypt. He requests that his granddaughter Elisabeth Bray, who had inherited a fatal insomnia caused by his gene altering on Clovis II, join him and assist him with the project, to which she agrees. 
Construction of the Morning Star Due to the death of the nineteen researchers, Clovis Bray would also construct the orbital platform above Europa known as the Morning Star to serve as a failsafe against any potential threat posed by Clarity Control. If a catastrophic event was to occur or to eliminate all the secrets within the facility if the Crypt's security was breached, the platform would excurse itself from orbit and crash into the site. It would later become primarily used by Clovis Bray as a control laboratory for the purpose of conducting a variety of different experiments related to the Exos. 
Construction of Vesper Station Around the orbit of Europa, Clovis Bray would establish the Vesper Station to conduct experiments that could potentially poorly interact poorly with his other investigations. Clovis would also create the central AI known as Astraea to oversee the station. Believing that their were more powerful variants of Vex that he could learn from, Clovis would construct an AI using Vex technology with the intention of it serving as a programmable Vex Mind that he could use for observation. However, the AI would prove itself to be too dangerous and the station would be placed into quarantine. 
Creation of the Exos During Clovis's attempts to create the Exos, early exominds would fall victim to what is known as the "loop/billboard/crash" cycle, characterized by cognitive and motor stereotypy (abnormal, repetitive behaviors), athetosis (slow, involuntary writhing movements of the limbs and extremities), and gradual loss of sapience. This ultimately claims the life of Clovis Bray II. Clovis steals a Vex from the Ishtar Collective and uses it to construct a gateway to the Vex colonized star system, the Forge Star. He discovers that exposing Vex radiolaria to "Clarity" solves the "loop/billboard/crash" problem. With this problem fixed, the Exos are successfully created.  
Despite fixing the "loop/billboard/crash" problem, Exominds would begin to fall victim to Dissociative Exomind Rejection (DER), when Exos do not feel comfortable in their new bodies. To solve this problem, Clovis comes up with two solutions. The first is a "reboot", which does not wipe the Exos memories, but instead wipes the mind's memory post-transfer, however, the procedure will likely have to be repeated multiple times. The second solution is to introduce familiar human organic conceits into their body, such as the instinct to eat or reproduce. 
Elsie Bray discovers that Vex microstructures have entered Europa's ice and were swiftly spreading across the icy moon. Due to this threat, she decides to allow her consciousness into an Exo. Upon storming into Clovis I's laboratory, Elsie berates him for the atrocities he had committed and demands he transfer her into an Exo body, to which he agrees. Clovis begins a full brain scan which copies her body but poisons her mind. The transfer is a success, however Elsie loses most of her memories in the process. 
The creation of Engrams and Glimmer Dr. Wilhelmina Bray develops the first Engram matter-encryption techniques based on relic crystals' unique datastatic properties. Glimmer is presumably developed as a byproduct and used as a source of power. 
Information about Plutarch's writing on Fabius Maximus was encoded onto an engram. The engram includes the type of warfare termed the 'Fabian Strategy' - the strategy involves attrition tactics and avoiding direct conflict until an enemy makes a mistake. 
The investigation of Ishtar Collective The Ishtar Collective captures a live Vex specimen and nearly go mad until a Warmind intervenes. They send a group of two hundred twenty-seven proxies into the Vex ruins to explore the Vex Network. 
Late Golden Age 
The Foundation of Future War Cult The Future War Cult is founded by Maya Sundaresh at Lhasa after experimenting with Vex technology. The group disbands, however, after many of its members either go insane, commit suicide, or leave out of ethical concerns. Maya Sundaresh is among them, quitting the program. 
The development of The Kestrel The Kestrel, an experimental long-range jumpship, is prototyped. 
A pilot designated SABER GREEN piloting the ship Secure ISIS communicates with ICE MINARET. Civilian launches are not scrubbed and colonization efforts are being pushed beyond schedule to preserve secrecy. They are carrying an antimatter payload of one annihilation-pumped caedometric weapon codenamed RIGOR, and two other unknown devices codenamed SKYSHOCK and APEX. ICE MINARET remarks that they both know where the order came from. 
The development of SIVA Clovis Bray begins developing technologies geared toward the colonization of the Solar System in the form of SIVA and Transmission. After going through several prototypes, SIVA is approved for deployment. 
Sometime later General Chen Lanshu glides around the Cosmodrome and converses with submind Malahayati about the possibility of invasion and speculates whether or not the Traveler could have been an enemy. Shortly thereafter, Chen Lanshu speaks to Willa Bray about the possibility of accelerating the colonization programs, and whether SIVA could be used for military purposes. 
The construction of Site 6 Site 6 is constructed. 
The Exodus Black crash 500 years before the Red War, the colony ship Exodus Black, carrying a cache of SIVA, is launched. Although Exodus Black's intended destination is the Kepler-186 system, the ship is intercepted by the Vex-inhabited centaur planetoid Nessus and crash-lands. The survivors briefly try to make contact with Earth and send for help, but their signals are never received. The Vex soon exterminated the survivors, leaving only Exodus Black's failsafe AI, Failsafe. 
ECHO Project Clovis Bray Corporation and the Ishtar Collective come together to begin Project ECHO, an extrasolar colonization project dedicated to traveling to the Andromeda Galaxy. They create the Ares Spire on Mars to serve as a research site. 
Creation of Soteria Using Vex technology, the Ishtar Collective creates the artificial intelligence Soteria, also known as the Augarmind, to research extrasolar colonization. 
Soteria detects over 300 suitable planets for colonization, however this number dwindled to a mere two within the Triangulum Galaxy due to an anomaly that made the routes unsafe. After forwarding this information to Rasputin, she was advised to speed up contingency plans for colony ship launches. 
Imprisonment of the Augarmind Against the orders of Clovis Bray I, Soteria would launch the ECHO project's Koranthin network on emergency scramble orders and prepare to send them out of the system. Clovis would contain the Augarmind within the Ares Spire and return commands would be issued to all ships. However Soteria attaches fragments of herself onto a large number of ECHO colony ships before being imprisoned. Maya Sundaresh was enraged at Clovis's actions and would resign from the project. 
The Tyrant's Son To gather information, Rasputin executes the protocol known as SIDDARTHA GOLEM. Under this protocol, an Exo bearing the same name is created and sent out into the world to interact with humans and learn about their behaviour, literature, and culture. 
Invasion of Europa Due to being on the verge of death, Clovis Bray I makes the choice to upload himself into an Exomind format. One copy of his mind would be installed as an artificial intelligence in the Deep Stone Crypt, located within a giant Exo head at Bray Exoscience that possesses his memories, while a second copy would be uploaded into a wiped Exobody. Meanwhile, Elsie Bray and her team prepare for their next foraging mission, but they are confronted by a large Vex force that emerges from the Glassway. They become overwhelmed by Belmon, Transcendent Mind, forcing them to retreat. Elsie meets up with Clovis I, who orders her to activate his AI, and she complies. 
Closing the Gateway Most of Eventide's population is slaughtered due to the Vex's invasion. Despite these causalities, the Clovis Bray AI refuses to allow an evacuation. Clovis-1 is awakened by Wen-1 following the orders of the AI, angering Elsie. Elsie then decides to form a rescue team, with Clovis-1 deciding to join them. Clovis-1 comes to the realization of who he is and seeks to make amends for what he has done by working with Elsie to stop the invasion, over time rebooting himself forty two times to become Clovis-43. Eventually, Elsie succeeds in stopping the Vex by shutting down the Glassway. After saving as many lives as possible, Elsie and Clovis-43 shut down the Clovis Bray AI. Due to the shame of who he was, Clovis-43, with the assistance of Elsie, uses the last of the radiolaria to reset himself and wipe his memories, becoming Banshee-44. 
The colony ship, Yang Liwei leaves Earth to find a way to live without the Traveler. 
Founding of the Black Armory Believing that Earth was under threat from a extraterrestrial enemy, the French House of Meyrin, Norse Rasmussen Clan, and the Japanese Satou tribe unite together to form the Black Armory. The families' matriarchs Henriette Meyrin, Helga Rasmussen, and Yuki Satou construct weapons, and build forges on Earth and Nessus. 
The terraforming of Io The Traveler begins terraforming Io. 
Members of the First Light colony investigate the tunnels beneath the Moon. They discover the Worms and the Hive nesting deep within but do not survive to tell the tale. 
The Collapse 
The Warmind Rasputin detects the sudden arrival of the Black Fleet outside the Solar System,  with the aid of the abandoned technology of the Future War Cult and the Augurmind Soteria.  He discovers this is the Black Fleet, led by the Witness, alongside its Disciples and SavathÃ»n. Recognizing the threat, Rasputin assumes control of humanity's Planetary Defense Network. 
The Traveler makes its "final exodus" from Io, leaving the moon's terraforming incomplete and fleeing to Earth as the Collapse begins. 
Rasputin attempts to defeat the Black Fleet using all available weapons, but to no avail. In a last-ditch attempt to stop the impending doom, Rasputin enacts ABHORRENT IMPERATIVE, and prepares to fire upon the Traveler with his most powerful weapons, thereby coercing it into a "pseudoaltrusitic" defensive action, should it attempt to leave. The Traveler, for reasons unknown, chooses to stay and fight. 
Xol, Nokris, and their brood arrive on Mars in an attempt to conquer the planet. Rasputin activates "SIBERIAN ENTROPY", freezing and trapping them below the Hellas Basin. 
Rasputin commissions the Yang Liwei as a warship, but they refuse to take a side in the conflict.  The battle between the Black Fleet and the Traveler, leads to the creation of a kugelblitz. It sucks the Yang Liwei into a newly formed pocket dimension made from Light and Darkness where time passes much quicker. The people aboard would lose their physical bodies and become beings of full potential. Mara Sov is the first to enter.  
As all countermeasures fail to affect the entity and defeat becomes a certainty, Rasputin decides to enact YUGA SUNDOWN and shuts down to protect itself, leaving billions of people to perish. 
Many of the ECHO ships are launched in an attempt to escape this apocalyptic event, however many of them are destroyed during their flight. One of these ships containing a submind of Soteria is caught in Neptune's gravity well and crashes into the ice giant's surface. 
First Fleet or quite possibly what comes to be known as the Cassini, is lost around the orbit of Saturn. 
On Mercury, Venus, and Mars, dormant Vex units reacting to the Collapse reactivate and begin terraforming several worlds. While Mercury is turned into a Machine World in days.  On Mercury, Dendron, Root Mind plants the planet-sized prediction engine which would become the Infinite Forest, with Panoptes, Infinite Mind serving as its Axis Mind. The Vex spread is temporarily stalled by the Traveler. 
A massive spacecraft bearing a sigil of Golden Age Earth on its prow crashes on an unidentified battle-scarred world where over two dozen Exo soldiers fight a titanic battle with the Vex. 
The Collapse The Black Fleet, believed by Humanity to be the Darkness itself, arrives at Earth. The assault is led by Nezarec, who had the Veil aboard his ship, alongside SavathÃ»n. They precipitated the Collapse and the abrupt end of the Golden Age. Earth's defenders are steadily beaten back until humanity is threatened with extinction. 
Despite the Black Armory's advanced weaponry, they are unable to fend of the Black Fleet's onslaught and are forced to abandon their hideouts and forges. Helga Rasmussen is killed, while Henriette Meyrin's daughter Adelaide is severely injured due to the attack. To save her daughter, Henriette agrees to have Yuki Satou upload Adelaide's consciousness into an Exo, thus creating Ada-1. 
SavathÃ»n betrays and kills Nezarec, cursing his remains and hides the Veil away on Neptune. She tricks the Witness into sparing the Traveler. Humanity is saved by the intervention of the Traveler, which sacrifices itself to stop the Black Fleet. Before going dormant, the Traveler creates the Ghosts, to seek out those who can wield its Light as a weapon. 
Crashing of the Lunar Pyramid Nezarec's ship crashes and is buried deep beneath the Moon. 
The fall of a shard of the Traveler A Shard of the Traveler lands in the European Dead Zone during its battle with the Black Fleet. 
Birth of the Awoken Being the first to enter and awaken in this new universe, Mara would shape the universe according to her will, choosing for her and the rest of the crew to exist as embodied entities. Alice the second to Awaken (now known as Alis) creates the planet known as the Distributary from her memories. Both Mara and Alis awaken on the Distributary. Mara tricks Alis into thinking she is the one who created the rules of the new universe. They both help awaken and incarnate the other members of the crew, including Mara's brother Uldren Sov, thus becoming the species known as the Awoken, a humanoid species made of both Light and Darkness and immortal as long as they remain within the Distributary. Alis becomes their first queen. 
Dark Age 
Main article: Dark Age 
Early Dark Age 
The Beginning of the Dark Age In the aftermath of the Collapse comes the Dark Age. It is a time of vast suffering and terrible evil. 
Founding of Neomuna Members of the Ishtar Collective aboard the Exodus Indigo arrive on Neptune due to Maya Sundaresh's recommendation to pursue a Vex signal, likely coming from the stranded fragment of Soteria. The researchers would discover the Veil on Neptune's surface and the submind of Soteria. Exo members of the crew would become braindead upon approaching the paracausal entity. Maya communicates with the Veil and becomes fascinated with it, declaring it would be their "salvation." The Ishtar Collective began the construction of Neomuna, using the Veil to power the city and conduct experiments. 
The First Human enclaves Many survivors of the Collapse gather within secret enclaves in desperate attempts to survive. Some Awoken return to Earth and the Exos emerge but their memories have been irreparably damaged. Ghosts travel among the refugee columns, seeking the first Guardians. 
The first defenders of the human survivors Before the first Guardians appear, rangers led by the legendary Ayane Takanome protect humanity's survivors. They disappear after the Guardians become commonplace. 
The arrival of the Fallen The Fallen arrived to the Sol System in their Ketches. The Fallen's Houses established throughout the entire System begin to loot and pillage humanity's former worlds and colonies, ending the Long Drift. The House of Devils and House of Kings settle on Earth, the House of Wolves on the Jovians, the House of Winter on Venus, and the House of Rain on Mercury. 
Discovery of the Lunar Pyramid The House of Wolves, led by their Kell Inaaks, discover the remains of Nezarec in the Lunar Pyramid. They split his corpse into different pieces to create the Dark Relics. 
Rebirth of Lakshmi-2 To more effectively analyze the psychic data coming from the Veil, Maya Sundaresh and Chioma Esi create a prototype to interface with the paracausal entity , designed like a "conductor" guiding a "symphony" of participants. Despite the death of the volunteers during the test, Maya Sundaresh continues her experiment by placing dead Exos in the Veil's interface, instead of biological human participants. Directing the data from the Exos to a central recipient. Maya creates her own mental imprint to be overlaid on the central Exo recipient. Lakshmi-2 awakens, now with the mental imprint of Maya and possessing some of her memories. 
Maya Sundaresh is found dead in the conductor's chair of the Veil's interface, with Chioma and the other Ishtar Collective researchers unsure of what she was attempting to do. However, unbeknownst to anyone, Maya's consciousness would continue to exist within the Darkness of the Veil. Eventually, Maya would infiltrate the Vex Network under the identifier "MSUND12." 
Creation of the CloudArk Using their studies of the Vex network, and the paracausal energy field from the Veil, the people of Neomuna create the virtual reality environment known as the CloudArk. The fragment of Soteria known as the Occlusion becomes a central part of the virtual reality construct. 
Formation of the Cloud Striders The Neomuni citizen Mikaela Julaha is caught in a accident with nanotechnology. Mikaela's strength and insurance would rapidly increase, however, her lifespan would be severely shortened. Others would allow themselves to undergo this procedure, becoming the Cloud Striders. Only two Cloud Striders can exist at a time. 
The Reawakening of the Warmind Rasputin would be reactivated and discover Neomuna, giving it the codename of "Nefele Stronghold". Chioma Esi sends the Cloud Strider Stargazer to go to Earth to stop the Warmind from learning more. Stargazer takes Lakshmi-2 with them and uses the submind Malahayati to wipe all mentions of Neptune. Lakshmi-2 is left behind on Earth. 
The Destruction of London The House of Devils destroy London around this time. 
The Arrival of the Cabal The Cabal Empire arrived to the Sol System. The Cabal scout legions established a beachhead on Phobos, constructing their bases, Fleetbase Korus and Firebase Thuria before invading Mars. Their initial intention was to mine Mars for resources, but the scope greatly expanded upon the discovery of the Vex ruins. However the Cabal soon become engaged in a massive campaign of attrition with a native Vex programming called the Virgo Prohibition, who desperately attempts to protect the entrance to the Black Garden from an ever-expanding Exclusion Zone. This war will continue throughout the Dark Age and well into the City Age with little outside interference. 
The arrival of the Hive The Hive's forces, consisting of the Hidden Swarm, Blood of Oryx and Spawn of Crota, invaded the Moon and established their subterranean base, known as the Hellmouth. 
The Appearance of the Warlords The first humans to be resurrected by the Traveler become Lightbearers and form the ruthless Warlords, bringing about chaos and anarchy. 
Mid-Dark Age 
The Formation of the Iron Lords Having had enough at last the tyranny of the Warlords, Lord Radegast brings Lord Saladin Forge and Lady Jolder together to end the Warlords, and forms the Iron Lords. 
The SIDDARTHA GOLEM Exo is raised as a Lightbearer and is given the name Felwinter by his Ghost. Enraged at the loss of his "son", Rasputin sends his Warsats and combat frames to kill the newly Risen-Exo. Fed up of running from Rasputin's assets, Felwinter decides to build a home on top of a mountain which he had discovered by using a map from a Seraph Station. Felwinter calls on the Warlord Castor, the ruler of the mountain to negotiate, however he destroys Castor's Ghost and throws the Warlord off the cliff, claiming the mountain as his own and naming it Felwinter Peak. 
Theodicy War The Theodicy War breaks out in the Distributary between the Sanguine and the Eccaleists. The Sanguine led by Queen Alis Li believed that the existence of their people was a gift and did not have to resolve the conflict between Light and Darkness. While the Eccaleists led by Mara Sov with Diasyrm as her puppet leader believe that the Awoken had to play a role in the conflict. Alis Lin steps down, and is succeeded by Nguya Pin. 
When the Diasyrm vanished at the end of the Theodicy War, believing she was secretly murdered by Mara Sov, Eccaleist Sjur Eido barges into a court of the Gensym Scribes, vowing to avenge her. Seeking to prevent another Theodicy War, they lend her resources for her mission. However when Queen Pin converted to Eccaleism, Sjur Eido would enter the Queen's court and deduce which one of Pin's courtiers was Mara. However, Sjur could not bring herself to kill Mara due to her beauty. Instead Sjur challenges Mara to a "duel to the agony" against her most beloved companion, Uldren Sov. They agree to three duals: one with knives, guns, and fighter aircraft. The first dual ends in a draw, the second went to Sjur, and the third went to Uldren. Due to this dual failing to determine the victor, Sjur submits her fate to Mara. 
The Confrontation with the Warlord Segoth The Iron Lords confront the Warlord Segoth as he travels to a secluded village. After a bloody battle, the Iron Lords emerge victorious and Segoth is gunned down by Perun as he attempts to escape. 
The recruitment of Lord Felwinter While patrolling the Mothyards, Felwinter encounters the Iron Lord Timur, who tells him about SIVA. Out of a desire for peace and security, Felwinter joins the Iron Lords, and gives them his mountain where they construct the Iron Temple as their base of operations. 
Rumors circulate of a haven beneath the Traveler. 
The Death of the Warlord Citan Lord Felwinter meets with the Warlord Citan to broker peace. Citan refuses, and the Exo puts him down. As his Ghost revives him once more, Felwinter uses his Shotgun, Felwinter's Lie to terminate them both. 
The Confrontation with the Warlord Rience The Iron Lords challenge the Warlord Rience. 
The Defense of Patch Run Lord Saladin, while he was patrolling at the outskirts of a town called Patch Run, he encountered a Fallen raiding party. A Lightbearer named Efrideet joins with him and, together, they defend the village against the fallen until they have no ammo. After the Fallen deploy a walker over a long distance, Efrideet suggests throwing Saladin against the walker. Before he could argue, Efrideet threw him, like a Javelin, against the Walker, destroying it in the process. After the battle, Lord Saladin, impressed with the force and character of Efrideet, convinced her to join with his group at Dwindler's Ridge. 
Late Dark Age 
The expedition of Lord Timur and Lord Felwinter Lord Timur and Lord Felwinter traverse the Arabian Shores in search of a facility belonging to Clovis Bray. While en route, they are attacked by a group of Fallen before discovering an old Clovis Bray facility in the secluded wastes. 
The Formation of the Pilgrim Guard The first Titans pledge to defend the refugees gathering to the Traveler, forming the Pilgrim Guard. 
The Formation of the Sunbreakers The Titans form the order of the Sunbreakers. 
Reports are made of a Cabal commander, Bracus Tho'ourg, who secured the Buried City on Mars with merely a fraction of the planet's Cabal forces. The first Guardians who faced him died at some point between here and the City Age. 
The City Age 
Main article: City Age - Many legends rise and fall during the City Ageâ€”the Lords of Iron; Saint-14; Toland and Osiris; the Speaker; and many othersâ€”not the least of which is a single Guardian, resurrected on the eve of the Darkness' return. 
Early City Age 
The Founding of the Last City Survivors of the Collapse, human, Awoken, and Exo, travel from far and wide to the site of the inactive Traveler and build the Last City beneath its protective aura. The City Age begins. 
Foundation of the Reef Mara Sov, Uldren Sov, and Sjur Eido lead many Awoken to leave the Distributary and return to Sol. Shortly after getting attacked by a Fallen Ketch, Mara Sov is crowned Queen of the Awoken  They would arrive in the asteroid field and found the Reef. Some Awoken choose to make their way to Earth. 
Creation of the Dreaming City Mara Sov seeks to create a safe and peaceful realm for the Awoken. Uldren Sov finds and brings the young Ahamkara, Riven of a Thousand Voices to Mara as a gift. . The Awoken Queen with the assistance of Riven's wish magic and constructs the Dreaming City. Riven constructs her lair in secret, hidden away from the Awoken. 
Over time, many Ahamkara travel to the Dreaming City. At the Spine of Keres, Riven meets Taranis. Unlike other Ahamkara, Taranis did not twist his wishes and the bargains he made were safe. Taranis invites Riven to his lair in the Black Garden, she accepts. they forge a bridge between their lairs in the Dreaming City and the Black Garden, and produce whims. 
The Faction Wars Power struggles between various political factions for the support of the City's refugee masses escalate into a series of violent conflicts. Rezyl Azzir, a great leader and champion during those days, helps unite the Risen and forms the Guardians, gaining him further fame. Together they end the bloodshed before the City is torn apart by the civil war, and focus on a new encroaching threat: the Fallen. 
Ada-1 arrives at the Last City, now the last member of the Black Armory after losing Yuki, and her mother Henriette to Warlords during the Dark Age. Opening a refuge within the walls of the city, Ada offers her weapons to anyone who needs to defend themselves. However she would refuse to work with the Vanguard due to her past experiences with the Warlords. 
New Monarchy coalesces in the wake of the Wars. In the aftermath, the Titans construct and defend the City's walls. 
The founding of the Consensus The Consensus, a representative body through which the factions could pursue their agendas peacefully, is formed following the Faction Wars to jointly govern the City with the Speaker. 
As the City continues to rise, Rezyl and the swelling numbers of Guardians see near constant action against the encroaching Fallen. 
The first Hive presence on Earth The Hive begin landing Seeder Ships on Earth in a centuries-long process intended to precede an invasion. Guardians eventually first learn of the Hive's presence at the Rusted Lands, the future site of a Crucible arena. 
The exile of Toland Toland, an esteemed and highly respected Warlock, is exiled from the Last City for his obsessive and dangerous studies on the Hive. He continues his work unabated. 
The first voyage to the Reef At some point, the first known voyage to the Reef is launched. 
The expedition to Ceres Dead Orbit launches an expedition in the Reef to Ceres where a space station had been discovered. However, an Awoken patrol ship spots them and cripples their ship, forcing them to move to the space station. None returns except a Ghost. 
Six Fronts The first major attack weathered by the City. Four orders of Titans led by the Iron Lords defended six different approaches against an overwhelming enemy force. None of the orders faltered, and what could have been a disastrous defeat would instead become a decisive victory. At this time, the Iron Lords become known for their invincible patrols.  Towards the battle's end, two Firebreak commanders including Lord Radegast, led a march against the Fallen and reclaimed five miles of scorched ground beyond the City's walls.   
The Speaker appoints Osiris as Vanguard Commander despite the Concordat's objections and dire claims following the battle of Six Fronts. 
Lord Timur and Felwinter would continue his search for SIVA, eventually they discover the coordinates of Site 6 in a Seraph Bunker. Although Felwinter doubted the information as he believed correctly that it was bait from Rasputin, they would report their findings to the rest of the Iron Lords. 
Upon discover the location of Site 6 the Iron Lords, having grown to the hundreds (including the Iron Wolves), decide to travel to Site 6 with the hopes of using SIVA to build starships and colonies. Despite Felwinter's attempts to reason with Rasputin, the Warmind would respond by activating defense mechanisms, including SIVA against them. Hundreds of Iron Lords and Wolves are killed, with only eight reaching the replication chamber. Ultimately all eight Iron Lords except Saladin sacrifice themselves to contain SIVA within the Site after it proves uncontrollable to even Rasputin. Only Saladin and Efrideet would survive devastating wrath of SIVA. Efrideet had not participated in the battle and had left Earth alongside other fellow Lightbearers who embraced pacifism. Rasputin would withdraw his countermeasures and begin to observe the Guardians, however he would be heartbroken over the fact that he had killed Felwinter and the unfixable damage that he had caused. 
The formation of the Six Coyotes The Six Coyotes, a legendary fireteam of Hunters, make the first survey beyond the Cosmodrome wall. 
The Formation of Cayde-6's crew Cayde-6, alongside Andal Brask, Shiro-4 and another Hunter, made a crew and take actions out of the City. They ran scout parties to search for survivors and lead them back to the City, mapped lost sites and hunted Fallen.  
Mid-City Age 
Great Ahamkara Hunt The Ahamkara are made extinct by order of the Vanguard to prevent Guardians from self-destruction. The Warlocks preserve some Ahamkara bones and fossils for study, and a few Hunters adorn their armor with scales. Riven and Taranis are the only survivors of this hunt and are separated, however they continue to whisper to each other. Mara Sov wishes for Riven to be trapped within the Keep of Voices to keep her contained. 
Warlord Naeem learns from Shaxx of an Ahamkara he had slain known as Hefnd. Seeking the power to start anew, she arrives at the castle where Hefnd was buried and greets the dead Ahamkara, wishing for his kindness. She attempts to convince him to allow her to use his bones to grant wishes to villages, to make up for her past as a ruthless Warlord, however Hefnd would refuse as it would barely feed his hunger. Naeem would then propose that she would face the consequences of the wishes, Hefnd agrees and a bargain is struck. Overtime a friendship forms between the two of them. However the House of Kings attack the castle and kill Naeem, in her final breath she wishes that her vengeance follows them into the grave. 
Rezyl Azzir goes to the Moon to "search [for] nightmares", and finds Hive Wizard Xyor, the Blessed He kills her consort and takes his chitin as a trophy to adorn Rose. 
Battle of Burning Lake The Hive invade Earth and make first contact with the Guardians. Though the Guardians successfully repel the invasion, Shaxx attempts to dissuade the Consensus from ordering a counterattack, arguing that the Hive's power needed to be understood before a proper offensive could be launched. In the years after, he begins developing the lost art of swordsmithing, reverse-engineering the dreaded Hive blades for use by Guardians. 
Great Disaster The Guardians launch an audacious offensive to reclaim the Moon from the Hive. The Ascendant Hive warrior Crota, the son of their God-King Oryx, brutally repels the attack, personally leading the Hive's forces and killing scores of Guardians with his fabled sword. Humbled, the Vanguard orders a full retreat and declares the Moon off-limits, hoping that the Hive will lose interest and refrain from invading Earth. 
Within the Ascendant Plane, two Knights - one of Oryx and Xivu Arath engage in a duel. Proving to be equally matched, the Knights decide to cast themselves into the Sea of Screams, to let its current decide their fate. This results in one of Crota's champions failing to receive a significant amount of tribute, which leads to his defeat against a sergeant of Xivu Arath. Due to losing a significant amount of temples and tributaries, Crota decides to sleep in his throne world to recover his tithes. He attaches his soul to an Ascendant crystal, so he can quickly return once his strength has returned, and entrust his sword with the Swarm Princes. 
The Tragedy of the First Crota Fireteam Seeking to avenge their lost allies and her lover Wei Ning, Eriana-3 leads a fireteam of Guardians consisting of Eris Morn, Vell Tarlowe, Omar Agah, Sai Mota, and Toland to the Moon to hunt down Crota. They camp out at the Anchor of Light, and enter the Temple of Crota after hearing the screams of Omnigul, Will of Crota. They are confronted by Alak-Hul, Verok, and their spawn. Underestimating his foes, Vell Tarlowe becomes overwhelmed by the spawn and is slain by Alak-Hul. The fireteam is separated, with Eriana-3 and Sai in one group, and Eris, Toland, and Omar in the other. Toland seeks out Ir YÃ»t, Deathsinger, the song kills him and casts his soul to the Ascendant Plane. Omar is captured by the Heart of Crota, who uses his Light to feed unborn Hive, resulting in his soul being transferred into an insect-like creature. Sai is killed by Omnigul, and Eriana-3 arrives at the entrance of Crota's Throne World and meets her demise to Ir YÃ»t. Only Eris would evade the Hive's wrath, losing her Ghost Brya and her eyes, surviving in the Hive's tunnels for years before escaping and later becoming one of Ikora Rey's Hidden. 
The Tragedy of Kabr's fireteam A fireteam consisting of Praedyth, Pahanin, Kabr, and three unknown Guardians lands on Venus and breaches the Vault of Glass, hoping to destroy Atheon, along with whatever secrets the Vex have hidden there, and return to the City in glory. The assault is a disaster, as Kabr's team encounters The Templar, whose impregnable shields and powerful weapons force the team deeper into the Vault of Glass. Only Pahanin escapes the Vault. One member, Praedyth is trapped by the Vex and lost in time, and the remaining Guardians are erased from existence. Kabr himself is not killed but instead goes mad, becoming obsessed with the Vex, fashioning armor and weapons from their corpses. In the end Kabr does not die but is assimilated by the Vex. In his last act Kabr creates the Aegis, a weapon capable of piercing the Templar's shields so that future fireteams will not meet his fate. 
The disappearance of Kauko Swiftriver Kauko Swiftriver, The Hunter Vanguard, disappeared without a trace. His disappearance left the Hunters without a Hunter Vanguard for the next two years.  
The First contact of Cayde's crew with Taniks Two years after the disappearance of Kauko Swiftriver, Cayde-6's crew are targeted by Taniks and in the first encounter the mercenary fallen killed Nian Ruo and left Lush without a ghost.

Andal Brask, new Hunter Vanguard Andal Brask lost the Dare and became the Hunter Vanguard.  
The Exile of Osiris Osiris begins to tire of repetitive strike missions and seemingly unproductive sessions with the Cryptarch before he is eventually noticed by the Speaker, who makes him his apprentice. Osiris' desire for truth, however, about the purpose of Guardians and the nature of Darkness causes division. His subsequent misuse of resources and the diversion of Guardians from their duties would result in the Speaker sending him to exile shortly after the Battle of Twilight Gap, as the Speaker believed he had become as obsessed with the Vex as Toland had with the Hive. After a bitter argument with the Speaker, Osiris is also exiled from the tower, and Ikora Rey replaces him as the Warlock Vanguard. 
The Battle of the Twilight Gap The Fallen leads the combined might of the united Houses of Devils, Kings, and Winter in an assault against the City. The battle is joined at Twilight Gap, just outside the City's walls. Vanguard Commander Lord Saladin Forge coordinates the City's defenses with his students Commander Zavala and Lord Shaxx. Though many Guardians fall in the ensuing battle, the united Fallen Houses are driven off with heavy casualties. In the aftermath of the Guardians' hard-won victory, the outermost sections of the City are evacuated and converted into fortifications, and the Vanguard decides to take a more proactive stance in fighting the forces of the Darkness by deploying strike teams against high-value enemy targets. 
The Crusade of Saint-14 After Twilight Gap, the legendary Titan and Exo Saint-14 rallies an army of Guardians to attack the Fallen surrounding the Last City. His campaign is successful and Fallen attacks on the City temporarily abate. During the campaign, he fights and kills Solkis, Kell of Devils. Shortly thereafter he goes in search of Osiris at the behest of the Speaker, heading for Mercury. Saint-14 enters the Infinite Forest and comes into conflict with the Descendants, who create Agioktis, Martyr Mind to drain Saint-14's Light. The Great Titan eventually meets his end.  Zavala becomes the Vanguard Commander and Titan Vanguard after Saint-14's disappearance. 
The Reef Wars As Twilight Gap rages on Earth, the Awoken of the Reef, allied with the IX, subdue the powerful House of Wolves. Battles include the Hildian Campaign and the Raze of Amethyst. After their Kell Virixas is killed, a brutal civil war among the Wolves ensues which sees Skolas emerge as the new Kell. Following Skolas's capture at the Cybele Uprising, the Wolves surrender and swear fealty to Queen Mara Sov rather than be totally destroyed. The Queen seals their nobility in the Prison of Elders and allows the rest to serve as her personal guards and servants. 
The Exile of Petra Venj Petra Venj is exiled to the Last City to serve as the Queen's Emissary as penance for murdering 9 Guardians and their Ghosts because of a miscommunication between the Awoken and the Vanguard. Sometime during this exile, she writes a letter asking to come home. 
Following the Reef Wars, the Cabal commander Valus Trau'ug attempts to authorize an invasion of the Reef. When he is denied by his superiors, Trau'ug massacres his own officers in an act of mutiny and leads his most loyal soldiers against the Queen. Trau'ug fails utterly as both he and his Broken Legion are interned in the Prison of Elders by unknown means. Their ships end up as part of the Reef graveyard. 
In the aftermath of the Reef Wars and the Twilight Gap, numerous rogues and outcasts of the Fallen houses band together to form the House of Exile on the moon and start to plunder the Hive fortress there. 
The Uprising of the Concordat The Concordat attempts a coup against the Consensus, fighting a battle against the New Monarchy at Bannerfall. In the wake of their defeat, the faction and their founder are expelled from the City. The Vanguard and the Speaker then approve the ascension of Future War Cult to replace the Concordat. 
Approximately 126 years before the SIVA Crisis The Faction Accords The negotiations known as the Faction Accords occurred. Andal Brask was involved in the process. Ikora Rey achieved the first recorded 25-match win streak in the Crucible. The Centaur planetoid Nessus re-enters the Solar System after an unexplained delay. 
Late City Age 
The Death of Andal Brask Andal Brask, the Hunter Vanguard, falls in battle with the vicious Fallen mercenary Taniks. Cayde-6 reluctantly assumes Brask's post in memory of his deceased friend. 
The investigation of the Dust Palace Holborn's Host investigates the Dust Palace on Mars, seeking a Warmind. While preparing for their assault on the Dust Palace, Holborn discovers a lost Ghost and attempts to communicate with it before inviting it to join them on their mission. The "sick" Ghost then wanders off, and Holborn continues on his quest. 
The Fall of Rezyl Azzir Rezyl Azzir becomes Dregen Yor, corrupted by the Hive trophies he has collected, and begins his campaign of destruction. 
The Campaign of Dredgen Yor Dredgen Yor murders fellow Guardians and civilians alike. His victims include the Crucible champion Thalor and the Hunters Pahanin and Jaren Ward. 
The Death of Dredgen Yor Yor is finally killed by Jaren Ward's adopted son, Shin Malphur and his handgun The Last Word after a fateful duel. All information relating to Rezyl becoming Dregen Yor is redacted by the Vanguard for fear of a demoralization. Only Shin and the Vanguard knew the truth. 
The formation of the Shadows of Yor Shin Malphur, realizing that Guardians will still be swayed by Yor's legacy, partners with Teben Grey and forms the Shadows of Yor. He takes on the name "Zyre Orsa", also known as "Dredgen Vale" and he used the Shadows of Yor to determine which Guardians were beginning to be swayed away from the Light. With the Vanguard's assistance, the Shadows of Yor become an established threat and begins to attract Yor cultists. Malphur begins hunting down those who join the Shadows, culling the weak and corruptible Guardians who would be easily swayed by the Darkness's powers.  
Fireteam Tuyet traverses the Ishtar Sink in search of Vex secrets. Unfortunately, the Vex find them first and Tuyet is lost in a last stand on the Shattered Coast. The intel they recover though is later used to forge Pocket Infinity. 
An unknown Hunter recons the Ishtar ruins searching for the Fallen House of Winter's Kellship. She is ambushed by Fallen troops before finally locating their Ketch. Rather than assaulting it herself, the Hunter instructs her Ghost to alert the Vanguard that Draksis, Winter Kell is at the Cinders. 
Creation of the Black Heart Cloud Strider Rohan enters the Black Garden, a mysterious realm outside of space and time occupied by the Sol Divisive, a Vex collective that serves the Witness. He witnesses the Conceptual Mind create the Black Heart using a "seed" planted by the Witness. He concludes that the Heart was the Sol Divisive's failed attempt to create a replica of the Veil. The Neomuni council refuse to take action. 
The Black Heart, despite being flawed, and failing to create the link the Witness desired, still shared a connection with the Traveler. This connection would create a cosmic static within the flow of Light and Darkness, weakening the Traveler. The Sol Divisive would prepare the Sol Progeny in their attempt to extend the Black Heart's powers into the Vault of Glass. Uldren experiences the Heart's corruption after entering the Black Garden from a Vex gate at the Valley of the Kings.

Main article: Taken War

Battle of Saturn The Taken War begins with the Battle of Saturn, as the Awoken space fleet engages the Dreadnaught and a small fleet of Hive warships escorted by thousands of Tombships; Uldren Sov leads his fighter wings to scatter the Hive fleet whilst from behind the Queen and her Techeun Coven summon the Harbingers, as part of a predetermined plan. The Harbingers destroy much of Oryx's fleet, ripping through enemy vessels with ease, but leave no marks upon the Dreadnaught itself. Oryx ends the battle by firing his ship's main cannon, destroying both his and the Queen's fleets in a single Pyrrhic stroke and forcing him to forestall his advance. The Queen and major parts of Reef leadership, including Paladin Abra Zire, and Techeun Shuro Chi, are considered missing in action. 
The Techeuns, Shuro Chi, Sedia, and Kalli are Taken due to the essence from the Dreadnaught. The Taken invade the Dreaming City.  Oryx encounters the Ahamkara Riven and bargains with her, wishing to Take her away. Riven is Taken and her identity appears to merge with Oryx's will.

The Vanguard scrubs the mission and orders the Guardian to return. Fighting through hordes of Taken the Guardian finally reaches the transmat zone where their ship is waiting and escapes. 
The Vanguard discusses the arrival of Oryx's Dreadnaught over a hologram Ghost collected, analysing its weapon to find a way to slip past while reflecting upon Mara Sov's sacrifice. Eris Morn interrupts them, proclaiming that her "stone" has spoken for the first time since Crota's defeat and has told her Oryx was coming to finish what his son started. Cayde-6 leaves the discussion to "see about a ship".

Unable to contain the mites' spread among the Guardians, the Owl Sector and Vanguard instead implemented a quarantine on the Last City to prevent non-Guardians' exposure. 
Bypass Authority Berriole travels to the Dust Palace to learn the origin of the tech mites. Following a set of tracks to a lab, she finds various locked storage cabinets had been cut or blasted open. Further investigation yields the mites were linked to a Clovis Bray project overseen by a Dr. Zarin Shirazi who worked under Dr. Willa Bray and that the tech mites were actually a nanomachine therapy to improve subjects' intelligence and strength for the Golden Age's colonization effort. After sealing Shirazi's lab, however, Berriole becomes aware that the tracks which led to the lab appeared to have been made by Fallen, implying that a group of Fallen (possibly the Splicers) were responsible for the incident. Eventually, a third of all Guardians become affected by at least one variety of tech mite, prompting the Vanguard to further tighten the City's quarantine. 
The Owl Sector's Liaison to the Vanguard, Shun Li, accidentally becomes exposed to a sample of tech mites and loses consciousness soon after, forcing his fellow operative Ramos to take on the duties of Acting Liaison. Fortunately, the countermeasure to the tech mites is discovered among Shirazi's records, and the combined efforts of the Owl Sector's research corps, the Hidden, and the Techeuns succeed in replicating it. Shun is revived, and the cure is administered to the Guardians, much to their dismay. With the crisis ended, the Owl Sector is returned to standby status. 
The SIVA Crisis begins when the Fallen House of Devils begins digging into old Golden Age research labs all over the system, eventually returning to the Cosmodrome while shifting massive amounts of resources to a previously dark region of Old Russia.

20 September King of the Mountain A Fallen force captures Felwinter Peak. Unable to get there in time, Lord Saladin orders the Guardian to secure the observatory at the top before it is too late. After defending the mountaintop from several waves of Fallen forces, the Guardian reaches the Iron Temple before defeating Sepiks Perfected in the courtyard, keeping the Fallen from the temple long enough for Saladin to arrive with reinforcements, but Sepiks escapes. 
The Walls Come Down Lord Saladin then sends the Guardian to pursue Sepiks Perfected into a transformed Cosmodrome to learn the extent of the SIVA outbreak. In the Cosmodrome, the Guardian encounters the Hive who are being driven into the open somehow. The Guardian then seeks out a monitoring station responsible for keeping the sensor grid online and retrieves vital sensor logs that provide valuable insight into the Fallen activity.  
The Plaguelands Pushing further into the Cosmodrome, the Guardian discovers that the Fallen have taken control of several Golden Age gun positions near the Bunker Triglav. Upon reaching the Bunker, the Guardian destroys two SIVA-enhanced shield generators before disabling the enemy guns. 
Back at the Iron Temple, Lord Saladin meets with the Guardian and tells them the story of the Iron Lords, and how they attempted to co-opt SIVA against all of Rasputin's attempts to stop them (including eliminating all but nine of the Iron Lords in the process). In the end, revealing how SIVA ultimately corrupted many of the Iron Lords by turning their weapons and armor against them, forcing Jolder to seal herself and all of the Iron Lords except for Saladin within the Bunker rather than let SIVA escape. Saladin then realizes the Fallen have not yet mastered SIVA, and sends the Guardian to meet with Tyra, a Cryptarch well versed in the origins of SIVA, and also one who might know the source of the Fallen's discoveries. 
Download Complete The Guardian then travels to an old Clovis Bray research lab following a hunch from Timur, who believes the answer to the Fallen's weakness may lie with the ancient SIVA prototypes. After clearing the facility of the Cabal, the Guardian locates an old archive that reveals information on several types of nanotech designed for differing purposes. The Guardian is then attacked by a Cabal force which they promptly eliminate before returning to the Iron Temple. 
The Iron Tomb Communing with the Guardian, Lord Saladin informs them that Shiro-4 has analyzed the Clovis Bray data and found a way to temporarily disrupt the Splicers' control over it. The Guardian is then tasked to descend into the SIVA replication complex to cut its ability to replicate itself. On the way, they reverse the power cells in the SIVA reactor, temporarily cutting off the Splicer's SIVA supply. Infiltrating The Archon's Keep, the Guardian descends deeper into the facility and after confronting the Remnant of Felwinter, destroys the SIVA Replicator via a self-destruct mechanism.

The Guardian arrives at the Giant's Husk, expecting to encounter hostilities, but finds the Hive engaged in all-out war. After the Guardian recovers a coded relay from a defeated Devil Splicer, Shiro deduces that the Hive may be attempting to reclaim something stolen and tasks the Guardian with exploring the Overpass for further clues. Working off of the pointers obtained from their exploration, the Guardian takes off for the Archon's keep in search of Hive or Fallen activity. At the keep, the Guardian discovers the Fallen Splicers are experimenting with the Hive, prompting them to seek out the Splicer's High Priest to end his madness. 
The Wretched Eye Kovik, Splicer Priest invades a Hive nest located within Bunker Triglav.

4 days after the Last City's fall After trekking for many miles in the City Outskirts, the Guardian realizes they are being led in a certain direction by a hawk. Finding a campsite littered with the corpses of killed Guardians, the Guardian scavenges a submachine gun and fights off a pack of War Beasts. 
1 week after the Last City's fall The Guardian reaches Twilight Gap, still following the hawk, and kills another War Beast pack led by a Legionary. After missing a jump and falling into a canyon, the Guardian is awoken by Suraya Hawthorne, who has helped many civilian City refugees find and repair old jumpships.

Once more empowered, the Guardian defeats the Fallen band and their leader, Skriviks, the Sharp-Eyed. 
A New Frontier The Guardian explores more of the European Dead Zone, encountering and defeating members of the House of Dusk. 
Calling Them Home To strengthen the communication network established by Devrim Kay and Hawthorne in the European Dead Zone, The Guardian is tasked to place signal amplification nodes across the EDZ. The Guardian destroyed the Fallen jamming devices in the Outskirts and ultimately traveled to Sojourner's Camp to place another node for the network, defeat the Fallen there, and secure their supplies for the Farm. 
Combustion After assisting Devrim Kay and Hawthorne in setting up a comms signal network that will help more refugees find the Farm, the Guardian learns that Commander Zavala has relocated to Titan with another group of survivors and is planning a counterattack against the Red Legion.

The Guardian is tasked to recapture the stolen supplies from the fallen thieves. After reaching them, The Guardian eliminated the crew and recovered the supplies. 
Bad Neighbors A conflict between the Hive and Fallen erupted on Titan and to prevent the destruction of the old structures of The Rig from a Fallen bomb, the Guardian is tasked to intervene and intercept the Fallen. After defeating the fallen, who were creating the bomb, The Guardian's Ghost then decided that the bomb could still be useful against the Hive nests at Tidal Anchor. Ghost used the Fallen's bomb components to craft his own bomb, which the player then used to destroy a Hive "Resonator" device, luring out the Hive in Tidal Anchor and killing all their forces. 
Deathless A Hive Knight, known as Takul-Dar, the Unbreakable, has been harassing Sloane's repair crews. To stop his attacks Sloane tasked The Guardian to kill him.

To stop his constant reincarnation, The Guardian defeated all the wizards responsible for the ritual. After defeating them, The Guardian finally killed Takul-Dar permanently. 
Siren Song The Hive produced gravitational waves by Hive magic to destabilize the Arcology. To counteract the Hive's attack, the Guardian tracked the waves back to their source, a Hive summoning ritual. After defeating all Hive forces, The Guardian interrupted the ritual. 
Utopia Commander Zavala and Sloane intercepted an encrypted high-priority Red Legion signal which they hope will provide them some insight into how to combat the Cabal. To decrypt the signal, Zavala ordered The Guardian to traverse deeper into the Arcology and retrieve a Golden Age CPU to crack the signal. Unfortunately, the signal revealed that the Red Legion had brought in the Almighty, a superweapon designed to shatter suns and destroy systems. In light of this overwhelming threat, Zavala asked the Guardian to locate the missing members of his fireteam: Cayde-6 and Ikora Rey. 
Looped The Guardian traveled to Nessus, the source of a strangely-amplified signal believed to be from Cayde-6. In the Arcadian Valley, the Guardian encountered a Golden Age AI, Failsafe, the sole survivor of the Exodus Black expedition launched 500 years ago. Failsafe confirmed that "the Cayde unit" is on the planetoid, but is trapped in a Vex teleporter network; Failsafe broadcasted the distress signal in the hopes that someone else would arrive to rescue Cayde. 
Six After tracking Cayde, the Guardian frees him from the network by stealing the original teleporter pad Cayde used, then defeats a band of Fallen before they breach Failsafe's core. Cayde reveals he wanted the teleporter to board Ghaul's ship and assassinate him, an act that would almost certainly have been a suicide mission but is brightened up when told that Zavala needs him back. Cayde directs the Guardian to Io to find Ikora Rey. 
Exodus Siege Zavala detects a Fallen scout near the Exodus Black. After killing the scout, the Young Wolf learns of a planned attack on the Exodus Black.

Release The Guardian investigates the Vex doing behavioural experiments on the Fallen and brings an end to it. 
Sacrilege The Guardian finds Ikora at Echo Mesa on Io, where she had gone to reflect on her inability to predict the Red Legion's invasion and the Guardians' loss of their powers. Without warning, a massive gout of the Traveler's energy erupts from Io's surface, a reaction provoked by Red Legion activity. Ikora sends the Guardian to investigate. The Red Legion base is found almost empty, the Cabal having accomplished their goal and now evacuating Io, but the Guardian discovers an unwelcome surprise: Taken.

Road Rage Asher Mir tasks the Guardian with stopping the Vex from attempting to gain access to the Warmind Vault. 
Fury When Asher Mir learns that Zavala's plan to save the Solar System is to blow up The Almighty, he insists that he can prove the Commander is wrong to do so. The Guardian infiltrates a long-empty Warmind vault, defeating more Taken along the way, and connects Asher to its systems to crunch data. Asher's fears are confirmed: The Almighty is linked directly to the Sun and will take the Sun with it if it is destroyed without severing that link. Meanwhile, the Speaker persuades Ghaul to earn the Traveler's favor to gain its power, despite The Consul's protests that their experiment on Io has given the Cabal the tools needed to seize the Light. 
Cliffhanger The Guardian kills Tekton, Constructive Mind and releases a virus on the Vex, created by Asher Mir. 
Postmodern Prometheus Asher Mir orders the Guardian to attempt an experiment to create Light, fighting off Vex and Taken while doing so. The experiment ends in failure. 
The planning of a counterattack The Vanguard reunites at The Farm and discusses their next move now that a frontal assault on the Almighty is out of the question. As The Guardian is the only one to have regained their Light, it is decided to send them to disable The Almighty while the Vanguard and a team of other Lightless Guardians carry out a simultaneous attack in the Last City to free the Traveler. Commander Zavala also reauthorizes Strikes at this time. 
Payback To reach the Almighty, the Guardian is charged with stealing a Cabal ship and the access code from the base in the EDZ. The Guardian uses a Drake Tank to advance through their defenses and disables the Cabal carrier, commanded by Thumos, the Unbroken, who has the access code to enter into the Almighty.

Larceny The Guardian fights throughout the Cabal base to secure the personal shuttle of Thumos and board the Almighty. 
1AU At The Almighty, the Guardian breaks through the vessel's security and overloads its core, breaking the link with the Sun and rendering the superweapon permanently inert. 
The Death of the Consul The Consul informs Ghaul of the disaster that had befallen their mightiest weapon and berates him for his hesitance. Ghaul realizes the truth of The Consul's words, but strangles him to death for his insubordination. 
Chosen The Guardian arrives in the Last City after the counterattack is underway. Fighting through the streets and across the rooftops, the Guardian rendezvouses with the Vanguard and uses the teleporter to board Ghaul's ship and confront the Dominus. Ghaul reveals he has already siphoned the Traveler's Light and gained the powers of a Guardian. Although the battle is fierce and Ghaul gathers more and more Light to strengthen himself, the Guardian prevails. Unexpectedly, Light bursts from Ghaul's corpse and takes his form, revealing that Ghaul has become Light incarnate. As Ghaul proclaims himself to be a god, however, Light begins to shine through the Traveler's cage. Miraculously, the Traveler finally reawakens, emitting a powerful wave of Light that shatters the cage and obliterates Ghaul. The other Guardians regain their Light and the Red Legion is forced to flee from the City, defeated for the first time in their history. 
The awakening of the Black Fleet The Traveler's Lightwave spreads across the Solar System and beyond. In intergalactic space, the wave washes over a mysterious fleet of ships that activates and begins moving in the direction of the wave's source.

They confront him in the Carrier and stop him. Hawthorne thanks them for saving the people through this effort. 
SavathÃ»n's Song While exploring the Arcology on Titan, the Hive ambushes a fireteam led by Taeko-3. Zavala asks the Guardian to investigate the last known location of the missing fireteam. They learn that the fireteam has been turned into Void crystals by a Hive ritual and that Taeko-3 has sacrificed herself to allow the Guardian to disrupt the ritual. They avenge Taeko-3 by destroying a massive Shrieker responsible for the ritual and report to Zavala on the fireteam's fate. 
The Inverted Spire The Vanguard receive intelligence from Failsafe that the Red Legion remnants have uncovered a secret threatening the planetoid of Nessus.

Season of the Hunt 
On the Cabal capital world of Torabatl, Uman'arath's concern over the threat that the Hive posed to the Cabal Empire grows into a fascination. She would begin to study the Hive with the aim of learning how the Cabal could evolve into greater warriors and would fall under the influence of SavathÃ»n. Upon being confronted by Caiatl, Uman'arath expresses her belief that the Cabal should dedicate themselves to the worship of the Hive Gods to ensure the survival of their species. Realizing the danger of Uman'arath's obsession, Caiatl orders her old friend to step down from her position on the council. 
Fall of Torobatl Sometime after being apprehended in the weaponsmith district of Torabatl, Uman'arath would begins to conduct a Hive ritual due to the influence of the Witch Queen. Alerted by Advisor Taurun of Uman'arath's activities, Caiatl travels to the weaponsmith district to discover that Uman'arath had begun a ritual dedicated to Xivu Arath. To halt the ritual, Caiatl would kill Uman'arath by impaling her with her ceremonial blade and pushing her into the fire. However, Caiatl inadvertently completes the ritual and summons Xivu Arath and her army to Torabatl through a massive portal. Unable to fend off Xivu Arath and her forces, the Cabal begin evacuating from Torobatl and chart a course to Sol to collect the scout legions sent by Ghaul. Caiatl is crowned Empress aboard her flagship, Eligos Lex V and begins formulating a plan to broker an alliance with the Guardians to retake Torobatl. 
10 November-17 November Osiris investigates planetary disappearance Following the arrival of the Black Fleet and subsequent disappearance of several celestial bodies within the Sol System, Osiris seeks out information on the Black Fleet and the Darkness. He promises to provide Zavala constant updates regarding his findings, sending him the Fang of Xivu Arath for further study. During his investigation, he visits the Reef in the hopes of finding out more of Empress Caiatl's plans for recruiting the old Red Legion troops.  
Rise of the Wrathborn As Osiris was investigating the Cabal presence in the Reef, he discovered a group of Cabal surrounding a Hive structure called a Cryptolith. The structure itself is organic, growing and rooting itself into the Tangled Shore. Concerned, Osiris scans the Sol System for more of the structures, getting readings on both the Tangled Shore and on Luna. In response, Osiris meets with the Spider, only to discover that there were more Cyptoliths than his scanner was picking up. 
Osiris visits the Dreadnaught In order to further understand the nature of the Cryptoliths, Osiris boards the derelict Dreadnaught. He learns of the internal fighting between the Hive, and the disappearance of SavathÃ»n. He also learns that Xivu Arath is now using the disarray to strengthen her own forces. Osiris returns to the Reef to confer with the Spider, learning the name of the Cryptoliths and their effect on the surrounding area. Osiris then heads to Luna to find more information. 
The Witch in the Phoenix Below the shadow of the Lunar Pyramid, Osiris discovers the entirety of the Scarlet Court, led by Crota's remaining lineage, communing with the High Celebrant of Xivu Arath, employed by the God of War to bring the Hidden Swarm under her fold. Osiris would interrupt the meeting and uses his Dawnblade to eliminate fifteen noble-brood, including Voshyr and her kin Yishra and Ayriax. He would then eliminate the fleeing Kinox, her son Ulg'Urin as well as his Knight guard. However, Xivu Arath would draw power from the Warlock's violence and use her will projected from a Cryptolith to dispel Osiris's Well of Radiance and attempt to convert him into a Wrathborn. As Osiris resists Xivu Arath's corruption, the High Celebrant carves and activates runes into the stone on either side of Osiris as a sacrifice to his master before departing into the depths of the Moon. However, Sagira would sacrifice herself to save Osiris, leaving him Lightless in the process. Unbeknownst to everyone, SavathÃ»n steals Osiris' body and voice, replacing him to get closer to the Guardian and gain a victory against her sister, Xivu Arath. 
17 November Trail of the Hunted SavathÃ»n, as Osiris, sends a message to the Vanguard, stating that his Ghost, Sagira, has been killed. He requests the Guardian aid him in his hunt for Xivu Arath. Zavala relays the information to the Guardian as they approach the location of "Osiris" on Luna. The Guardian makes their way through the Hellmouth, following "Osiris" and a new Hive: the High Celebrant of Xivu Arath. As the Guardian reaches the Shrine of Oryx, "Osiris" is attacked by a Wrathborn and almost killed. An unknown Guardian steps from the shadows, killing the Wrathborn with his sword. The unknown Guardian then steps into the light, revealing to "Osiris" and The Guardian that he is Uldren Sov. Uldren then introduces himself as Crow. 
Crow meets the Guardian It is revealed that after Uldren Sov's death at the hands of the Guardian, he was revived by the ghost Glint. Now a Guardian with amnesia, Uldren did not know about the crimes he had committed as the Awoken prince. Sometime later, the Spider found him wandering along the Reef and brought him in, giving him a new name: Crow. 
17 November-4 January Hunt for the Wrathborn Over the weeks, the Guardian and Crow with assistance from "Osiris" hunt down the Wrathborn across the Reef. Using Crow's Cryptolith Lure, the Guardian summons and defeats Wrathborn Fallen and Wrathborn Hive at the Cryptoliths scattered along the Reef and the Moon. As the Guardian kills more Wrathborn, they upgrade the Cryptolith Lure to track down the High Celebrant of Xivu Arath. During this time, Crow begins to receive visions from the Traveler leading him and The Guardian to discovering and reforging a new Hawkmoon from the Shard of the Traveler in the European Dead Zone. In reforging this weapon, the two end up defending the EDZ Shard from forces of the Darkness sent by SavathÃ»n.   
5 January Coup de GrÃ¢ce The Guardian and Crow track the High Celebrant of Xivu Arath to the Dreaming City, using a fully upgraded Cryptolith Lure to summon it out of hiding. While The Guardian hunts the High Celebrant in the Dreaming City, Crow follows it through the Ascendant Realm, keeping pressure on the High Celebrant. The Guardian and Crow finally trap the High Celebrant in the Ascendant realm and together they trap and kill it, preventing the creation of more Wrathborn. 
Crow's Freedom After killing the High Celebrant of Xivu Arath, the Spider offers the Guardian a gift of a "prized bauble" from his lair. The Guardian points at Crow, choosing Crow's freedom as payment. The Spider is infuriated by this, but decides to uphold his end of the deal, freeing the Crow from Spider's service. Shortly after, Crow meets with "Osiris" someplace in the European Dead Zone, where they discuss Crow's future and his need to remain disguised within the Last City]]. "Osiris" promises Crow that were anything to happen to Crow, he was someone who could be trusted.

They follow mysterious traces of Void Light upon landing on the Lure, only to discover that they are soon encountering the Hive imbued with the power of the Traveler's Light and Lucent Moths. Before they begin to intercept SavathÃ»n, they recover another artifact linked to the Black Fleet. They intercept SavathÃ»n; however, she escapes, and a Knight takes her place.

The Investigation The Guardian teams up with Hidden operatives to learn more about how the Lucent Hive were able to retrieve the Light. The Guardian returns to SavathÃ»n's Throne World to gather clues to SavathÃ»n's plans through Deepsight obtained from the artifact they recovered from the Lure earlier. While exploring the Throne World, they are contacted by the turncoat Hive Ghost named Fynch, who requests an audience with them outside the Florescent Canal. They face a Lightbearing Wizard with Arc Light and the Scorn invading the Throne World. They finally meet Fynch, the turncoat Hive Ghost who refuses to revive his Knight, though the Ghost is suspicious of him and has Ikora spy on Fynch in case he lies to both of them. Fynch then gives the Guardian a lead on the first clue: Sagira's Ghost Shell. 
The Ghosts The Guardian gets a lead on Sagira's Ghost Shell found inside the Temple of the Wrathful, a temple dedicated to Xivu Arath. Fynch reveals to the Ghost and Ikora that the Scorn are led by Rhulk, a Disciple of the Witness, and are invading the Throne World as revenge for SavathÃ»n placing a Light curse on Rhulk using the Wellspring. They face Brutiks, Lightbane, who is guarding Sagira's Ghost Shell, and defeat him. They recover the Ghost Shell and it plays a memory of SavathÃ»n revealing the identity of the Witness. 
The Communion Eris advises the Guardian to return to the Europan Pyramid to enhance their Deepsight abilities so they can uncover the memory of SavathÃ»n further. They enter the Europan Pyramid after clearing out the Cabal led by Valus Dralgur, whose band of soldiers were exiled by Caiatl for their attempts to retrieve Darkness-related artifacts to win the war against the Hive under Xivu Arath. They learn from Eris the devastation the Cabal faced during the Fall of Torobatl after defeating the Imperial Deserter. They defeat the Valus attempting to destroy the statue the Guardian needs to commune with to enhance their Deepsight ability and commune with it. 
The Mirror With their Deepsight abilities now enhanced, The Guardian returns to SavathÃ»n's Throne World to gain access to the Altar of Reflection through a passage within the Witch's Echo, destroying Pyramid Spikes and Scorn resistance along the way. The Guardian presents Sagira's Ghost Shell, replaying the memory of SavathÃ»n revealing the identity of the Witness, but also revealing her plan to impersonate Osiris and learn the secrets of the Light. Fynch then briefs the Guardian on the next clue needed to uncover SavathÃ»n's plan. 
The Lightblade Fynch reveals that the next clue needed to uncover SavathÃ»n's plan is the Tablet of Ruin located inside the Temple of the Navigator, a temple dedicated to Oryx. To reach the temple, the Guardian would enter a Hive boat to cross the canals, then navigate the dark swamp. They reach the temple housing the Tablet of Ruin guarded by Alak-Hul, the Lightblade, Oryx's adversary reborn in the Light. They defeat him and take the Tablet of Ruin to the Altar of Reflection, where SavathÃ»n reveals her plan to move the Traveler to her Throne World. They inform Ikora of SavathÃ»n's plan to move the Traveler and get a lead on the next clue from Fynch. 
The Cunning The next clue needed to uncover SavathÃ»n's plan for the Traveler is located in the Temple of the Cunning, a temple dedicated to SavathÃ»n's younger self Sathona. The Guardian is tasked with recovering a calcified Worm familiar that Sathona and the Osmium King]] heard the warning of the God-Wave forming on Fundament. They retrieve the Worm familiar from the statue of Sathona, but on their escape from the temple, they are forced to fight the illusion of an Ahamkara. They escape the temple and attempt to bring the familiar to the Altar of Reflection, only for them to lose access to the Altar. Upon returning to the Enclave, they overhear a dialogue between Ikora, Eris, and Zavala. Eris receives a tip from Mara on the final clue. 
The Last Chance Mara informs Eris of the final clue needed to uncover SavathÃ»n's plan who then relays it to the Guardian: a shard of the crystalline prison Mara used to trap SavathÃ»n, located inside the Apothecary, the site of SavathÃ»n's experiments with the Light. They defeat a Wizard lieutenant loyal to SavathÃ»n, SavathÃ»n's Right Hand, guarding the shard. They bring the shard to the Altar of Reflection, where it reveals the final moments of SavathÃ»n following the exorcism and her rebirth in the Traveler's Light by Immaru. SavathÃ»n tricks the Guardian into recovering the memories for her and attacks them using the Light. The Guardian relays the memory to the Vanguard, where the revelation of the Traveler resurrecting SavathÃ»n shocks Zavala. Ikora and the Guardian leave the Last City, determined to stop a ritual that will bind the Traveler to SavathÃ»n's Throne World. Before they do so, Ikora uses the Relic to unlock the memories of the Worm familiar, revealing that the Hive were tricked into serving the Darkness by the Witness. Ikora relays the memory recorded in the Worm familiar to the Guardian. 
The Ritual Running out of time to stop SavathÃ»n's plan from coming to fruition, the Guardian crosses the Court of Thorns and climbs up to the Sanctum of the Brood Queen, where they confront SavathÃ»n. They are forced to defeat a fireteam of Lightbearing Hive, composed of a Lightbearing Knight with Void Light, a Lightbearing Wizard with Arc Light, and a Lightbearing Acolyte with Solar Light while engaging her. They defeat her, but Immaru resurrects her. The Guardian is forced to fight her with a different strategy. The Ghost proposes that the Guardian show her the same memory that Ikora relayed to them of the Witness tricking the Hive into service for the Darkness. The revelation angers her, and for the first time, SavathÃ»n's web of lies is unraveled, allowing the Guardian to gain the upper hand over her. They finally defeat her, but Immaru disappears along with the Traveler from her Throne World. The Guardian tells the Ghost that now they must prepare for the Witness's arrival to Sol and do whatever they can to prevent a repeat of the Collapse. 
Birthplace of the Vile Mara Sov summons the Guardian to the Enclave and briefs them of a plan to weaponize SavathÃ»n's Worm. They infiltrate the Dark City to recover an incubator and defend her as she binds the Worm to a grenade launcher, now named Parasite, through a Hive ritual. Before leaving the Throne World, she instructs them to pay attention to the words of SavathÃ»n's Worm in the future. 
22 February-15 March The Coalition forms The coalition between the Imperial Cabal and the Vanguard forms when Zavala asks for Caiatl's help in stopping the Lucent Hive on Earth, which she agrees to, and supplies the Guardian with a Synaptic Spear. Caiatl and Saladin form a plan to capture Lucent Hive lieutenants by using the Psions to connect the Guardians to the Lucent Hive lieutenant's Light via the Mindscape. They learn that an invasion force is being gathered on Luna and the Guardian stops them with assistance from Cabal allies deployed by Caiatl. While the Guardian stops the invasion, Crow puts the coalition in danger after he accidentally kills the Psion running the Psisorium, infuriating Caiatl. Saladin repays Crow's life debt by becoming a member of Caiatl's War Council as Bracus Forge, and eventually Valus Forge. 
5 March Duel with the First Disciple Before the Guardian enters the Sunken Pyramid, the Witness is seen monologuing in private towards the Traveler, expressing its belief that it is failing the various races of Sol, beginning the war between the forces of Sol and the forces of the Witness. Its first Disciple, Rhulk, invites the Guardian into his Pyramid after the Light curse placed on him by SavathÃ»n weakens through her defeat. They shut down a superweapon located inside, The Upended, and defeat him despite his Dark powers. They regularly return to the Pyramid to clear out the Scorn attempting to gain technology from inside. While exploring the Sunken Pyramid during these clear-outs, the Guardian learns of Rhulk's origins including his home system of Lubrae, his role in the attempted recruitment of the Ahslid, the servitude of the Worm Gods to the Darkness, and his adversarial relationship with SavathÃ»n. 
- Vox Obscura Caiatl asks the Guardian to return to Mars to shut down Psionic propaganda broadcasts, which are convincing her Psions to defect to the forces of the Witness, created by Yirix and spread by Qabix. This propaganda consisted of Psion history before their enslavement by the Cabal, the prophesied resurrection of Eramis, the predicted fall of the Last City, the Traveler becoming tainted with Darkness, and the impending return of the Leviathan. It became apparent that Calus is the being rallying the Psion forces to make these broadcasts.

They do so and make their way to the first severance ritual site with Crow. His Nightmare summons the Nightmare of the Fanatic, where the Guardian uses the Scythe to defeat the minions and slay the Nightmare. Crow's first attempt fails. Eris and the Guardian would use a different strategy to sever the Nightmare through acceptance with Crow. The second attempt is a success, turning the Nightmare into a Memory.

After binding the Nightmare in the Castellum to the Nightmare Harvester, the Guardian infiltrates a different section of the Leviathan's underbelly with Zavala. He is ambushed by both the Scorn and the remnants of House Devils. The Nightmare of Kethiks was summoned by the Nightmare of Safiyah to introduce the Guardian to her killer, Kethiks, the Yet-Proven. Zavala surrenders to his grief, failing the first time. Eris recounts the story of Zavala's life before he became a Vanguard Commander, which includes his son Hakim, to the Guardian before they try the severance ritual again. He succeeds and the Memory of Safiyah gives Zavala advice to let go of his grief. Eris discovers that one more Nightmare needs to be severed before they can strike at Calus. 
21 June-28 June Severing the Nightmare of Dominus Ghaul Caiatl is up last to participate in the severance ritual with the Guardian, but without the warding, she is vulnerable to the Nightmares in the derelict Leviathan. She sends a message to the Vanguard declaring her challenge against the Nightmare. Zavala and Eris order the Guardian to find her, fighting alongside the Imperial Cabal. The Nightmare of Dominus Ghaul reveals himself to the Guardian. Caiatl fails in the severance ritual due to her failure to lead the Cabal empire effectively. Eris learns the Loyalists and the Hive under Xivu Arath are working together and has the Guardian investigate a possible lead on Calus. They return to the Enduring Abyss and learn that Calus is attempting to merge his consciousness with the Lunar Pyramid. After Eris performs a ritual that gives Caiatl the warding needed to protect her from the Nightmares, she and the Guardian try the severance ritual again. While making their way to the ritual, Calus begins his plan to merge his consciousness to the Lunar Pyramid with the aid of the Witness. Caiatl can complete the severance ritual by turning her Nightmare into the Memory of Dominus Ghaul, finally breaking Calus's control of the Nightmares. Eris tells the Guardian to continue Nightmare containment while she uncovers more of Calus's plans. 
5 July The Final Severance Ritual Eris informs the Guardian that although they were too late in stopping Calus from merging his consciousness into the Lunar Pyramid, it is not yet complete and that the final severance ritual would require the combined efforts of her, Crow, Zavala, the Guardian, and Caiatl. After gathering the necessary reagents needed to conduct the final severance ritual, they finally strike on Calus, but he anticipates their arrival and has his forces ambush Crow, Zavala, and Caiatl. The Guardian infiltrates the throne room of the derelict Leviathan on Zavala's order to find and assist Caiatl before the Lunar Pyramid blocks the comms. They enter the Chantry of the Darkest Hour within the Lunar Pyramid by using the resonant portal in the room full of Calus's robotic effigies and find Caiatl there. With Caiatl's assistance, they lure out Calus, now the harbinger of the next Collapse, with the Nightmare Harvester. Working together, Caiatl and the Guardian defeat waves of Nightmares brought forth by Calus, breaking his connection to the pyramid. His consciousness is defeated and the Memories of Uldren Sov, Safiyah, and Dominus Ghaul fade as Zavala and Caiatl comfort each other. Eris tells the Guardian that Calus's influence is pushed back and that it is only the beginning of the end as the Witness will arrive soon, but she also sends a voice message to the Drifter inviting him to uncover more secrets of the Lunar Pyramid with her. 
19 July Bonfire Bash As part of the 5th anniversary of the Solstice of Heroes, now simplified to Solstice, and the Cabal in Caiatl's service celebrating it for the first time alongside the Eliksni of House Light and the denizens of the Last City, Amanda Holliday introduces a new tradition where Guardians light up a paracausal bonfire at the center of the EAZ and stop the Taken from extinguishing the bonfire. To light the bonfire, they need to defeat Ignition Carriers and throw the igniters near the bonfire. They fully embrace the bonfire after defeating a Taken Heat-Drinker and enjoy the new tradition with overwhelming support from Zavala, Ikora, Caiatl, Mithrax, etc. 
16 August Calus's Message Calus sends a message at the War Table of the H.E.L.M. telling the Guardian that they will soon meet again in Darkness by declaring his servitude to the Witness. The Guardian speaks with Zavala regarding the message, which was projected across the Last City as well. This prompts Zavala to begin his preparation for Calus's next move. 
Season of Plunder 
23 August Eramis' Freedom The Witness breaks Eramis free from her Stasis prison and instructs her to rally the pirate crews to her command to recover relics imbued with Darkness energy. Meanwhile, the Drifter tasks the Guardian to recover an asset captured by the Eliksni of House Salvation on Europa. The asset is revealed to be the Spider, who managed to escape the Tangled Shore through his personal Ketch. Spider instructs the Guardian to rescue his Ketch with assistance from his crew, who the Guardian eventually recruits: Halsiks the Sniper, SCUR-V the Servitor, and the Skiffblades. They learn that Eramis is on the loose again. The Drifter brings Spider to the Eliksni Quarter of the Last City, where his associates ally with the Eliksni of House Light due to the history Spider had with Mithrax when they served under House Wolves. He sets up shop in the Ether Tank, a bar located in the center of the Eliksni Quarter. There, the Guardian meets with the Drifter, Mithrax, and Eido to formulate a plan to prevent Eramis from successfully rallying the old crews of Ketchkillers, Skiffblades, and pirates. The Drifter hands the Guardian a Skeleton Key and promotes them to be a pirate captain on their personal Ketch gifted to them by the Spider. They assemble the crew to travel to the Themis Cluster to board an enemy Ketch, defeat the captain, and plunder their loot. Then, they use a Star Chart and the Captain's Atlas to go on an Expedition in search of clues to a pirate hideout within the Themis Cluster. They discover the first pirate hideout guarded by Cabal defectors under Val'aug, the Brute's leadership. They defeat her and recover a relic imbued with Darkness energy. They present it to Eido through a table adjacent to the Star Chart for further research and insight. 
30 August-11 October Recovering the Relics Mithrax, Spider, Eido, and Drifter assist the Guardian in locating more relics after completing an Expedition. They start by infiltrating the pirate hideout led by Iriks, the Sharpshooter on Eramis's behalf, then raid another hideout ruled by a pair of Gladiators named Tagh'al and Thagh'urn. After returning enough relics, Eido learns that the relics they recovered contain body parts of a Disciple of the Witness once in charge of the Lunar Pyramid before the Eliksni raided it and split the parts into various relics. With this knowledge in hand, the Guardian recovers more relics by first stopping a Lucent Hive raid on the pirate hideout led by Ei Arat, Trespasser, who recently killed another pirate lord in charge named Vrisk, the Coward. Then, they deal with another ruthless pirate lord who intimidates his fellow Eliksni: Arask, the Bully. Eido, Mithrax, and the Guardian learn from Eramis that the body parts belonged to Nezarec and the relics containing them were really the tombs of Nezarec. The Guardian continues the hunt by infiltrating the hideout of an Eliksni capable of commanding Cabal war beasts named Alaaks, the Beast Tamer, then enters a hideout of a scrapworking facility with Ithyks, the Scrapworker as its warden, and finally pursue Eido as she recovers the last relic alone by stopping another Lucent Hive raid led by Hiak'ar, Hoardseeker. Eido and the Guardian witness a duel between Mithrax and Eramis with Eido pleading both of them to stop. They do, and Eramis flees on her Ketch. Upon the placement of the last relic, Eido tells them that it will take time to determine how the relics can used for good and warns them of a mysterious curse. 
18 October-8 November New Information on the Headless Ones Eido begins her research into the Headless Ones and concludes that the Headless Ones were created during the Golden Age through a holiday known as the Halls Between and reveals that the traditions of the Halls Between survived into the Festival of the Lost through their shared usage of masks. 
29 November The Phoenix Rises Again After the Guardian helps out the Eliksni of House Light in making improvements to the Eliksni Quarter, Mithrax discovers a way to harness the relics of Nezarec to be used for good. He uses a conversion ritual to purify the body parts and reduce them to a concoction. He then delivers it to Saint-14 so the comatose Osiris can be its intended recipient. Osiris finally wakes after drinking the concoction and shares his experience of being possessed by the Witch Queen, such as the vision of Neptune, with Saint-14 before they embrace each other. 
Season of the Seraph 
6 December Ana's Restored Hope With the Witness fast approaching and all efforts to revive Rasputin bearing no fruit, the newly-awakened Osiris suggests to Ana Bray that they make contact with the AI of Clovis Bray I since he may have the knowledge needed to rebuild Rasputin. Ana is hesitant but agrees to Osiris's proposal, so they send the Guardian to Europa, into Bray Exoscience. After bypassing a deadly security system, Ana is shocked when she learns that Xivu Arath has made a foothold on Europa by using her Cryptoliths to turn the Eliksni of House Salvation to fight for her, thereby turning them into Wrathborn. The Guardian encounters more of Xivu Arath's forces including a Deathtongue Chorister that uses Xivu Arath's Battlesong to enhance her Wrathborn soldiers and suppress the Guardian's abilities through a totem. The AI of Clovis Bray I requests the Guardian's assistance in driving out the remaining forces of Xivu Arath invading the Creation wing of Bray Exoscience, defeating Techwizard Malykuh, Salvation's Warden. They reactivate the security protocols and witness a conversation between Clovis I, his granddaughter, and Osiris. Ana uploads Clovis I into an experimental Exo frame intended for Rasputin in the H.E.L.M., and he tasks the Guardian with recovering a submind of Rasputin: Malahayati. Before they set off to recover the first submind, Mara Sov informs them of Xivu Arath's plan to weaponize Rasputin's Warsat network to be used against the Last City. The coordinates to the submind lay within the Seraph bunker on Luna, so they head there. They learn that the Scorn are attempting to retrieve the submind, so the Guardian stops its leader: Once-Phyris, the Exhumed Tether, a lieutenant of Eramis reanimated as a Scorn. They are then tasked with retrieving an AI framework on Europa, fighting through Wrathborn forces and defeating the Warwatcher, Eye of Xivu Arath. After retrieving data from the submind Malahayati and the AI framework, they travel to a Seraph facility located outside the Last City. They bypass the security systems, clear out the Hive inside and defeat a lieutenant of Xivu Arath: Sumok, Ravager of Torobatl. They inform both Clovis I and Ana of their success and both begin their work to locate the next submind of Rasputin. 
9 December Skirmish on the Spire of the Watcher The Hidden reveal to Ikora that a specific facility has reactivated for the first time following the Collapse within a temporal anomaly on Mars. Ikora dispatches the Guardian to the facility on Osiris's behalf. The facility is under attack by the Vex of the Sol Divisive, the collective pledging their allegiance to the Witness. The Guardian uses Arc circuits to open doors and lifts leading to the Ares Spire. They ascend to the top of the Ares Spire and defeat Akelous, the Siren's Current, an Axis Mind used by the Witness to collect power at the facility. After the defeat of Akelous, Osiris reveals to the Guardian that the facility's reactor is experiencing a meltdown and tasks them with stopping the Vex from denying the secrets held inside. They encounter Persys, Primordial Ruin, another Axis Mind used by the Witness and also the first Wyvern of the Sol Divisive encountered by Guardians. Defeating Persys, the meltdown is prevented, and the Vanguard begin collecting important data from the facility. Initial findings are reported to Ikora. 
13 December Recovery of Charlemagne The Bray family argue over Clovis I's trustworthiness of the knowledge needed to rebuild Rasputin before Ana and Elsie Bray take it outside the H.E.L.M.. Clovis I apologizes to the Guardian for witnessing their argument and informs them that the next submind of Rasputin they must recover is Charlemagne, and the coordinates to the submind lay near the BrayTech Futurescape on Mars, so they head there next. The Hive are attempting to extract the submind, so the Guardian defeats their leader: Kelgorath, now a Darkblade serving Xivu Arath and uses the root kernel on Charlemagne as they have done on Malahayati. They return to the Seraph facility outside the Last City, defeat a pair of powerful Wizards named Ir Nithra, Scourge of the Ammonite and Ir Hanal, Scourge of the Dakaua, and upload the submind to a Seraph orbital facility above Earth. Clovis I tells the Guardian that Rasputin has changed the old launch codes and encrypted the new ones, so he begins to work to locate the next submind. 
20 December Operation: Seraph's Shield Clovis I informs that although Rasputin's subminds have been reintegrated, the data needed to rebuild Rasputin is still missing, so he and Elsie instruct the Guardian to board the Seraph orbital facility and upload a virus developed from Xivu Arath's usage of the Cryptoliths to corrupt the Warsat network. They use the augments dropped by the Splicers of House Salvation to explore the orbital facility and defeat both the Hive and Eliksni attempting to stop them. They willingly surrender and then escape the Ketch belonging to House Salvation before returning to the orbital facility. They defeat a powerful Knight named Haroktha, Scourge of the Helium Drinkers before confronting Praksis, the first Scorn seen using Stasis weaponry made by House Salvation, defeating him. They upload the virus and discover the blueprints of a weapon made from a combination of HÃ¤kke and Pyramid technologies: Revision Zero. They inform Clovis I of their endeavors and the frame rewards them with the original copy of Revision Zero before Fenchurch Everis contacts them via the frame. After extracting its weapon pattern, they take Revision Zero to the Enclave on Mars and discover that it is the first weapon capable of changing its Exotic traits and catalysts through reshaping through Deepsight Resonance. 
27 December Rasputin's Awakening Ana discovers a way to speed up Rasputin's recovery, but first, the Guardian needs to collect more submind data. She discovers that Felwinter was made as an independent AI by Rasputin following the Collapse and his Ghost Felspring holds the data needed. With Saladin's permission, the Guardian returns to Felwinter Peak to find the remnants of Felspring. Unfortunately, House Salvation has intercepted the communications between them and Ana, so they are tasked with defending Felwinter Peak from their forces with assistance from the Cabal in service of Caiatl. They eliminate the platoon and their leader: Rilliks, Instrument of Xivu Arath before they rekindle the flames and interact with Felspring's remains. After Ana uploads the memories of Felwinter, Rasputin is finally awoken and reveals to both Ana and the Guardian the true nature of Clovis I's plans. Rasputin was created by him to exert dominance over humanity, but Ana's intervention saved them from his hubris, with Rasputin defying him by rewriting his old protocols, locking him out. Clovis I attempted to use Rasputin's network to become a god himself. Ana confronts Clovis I about the revelation aboard the H.E.L.M. with Elsie and the Guardian in tow. He reassures them that his actions were in the best interests of humanity by doing more than the Traveler, citing the Whirlwind, the Collapse, and SavathÃ»n's acquisition of the Light as examples of the Traveler's fallacies. Ana rejects Clovis I's lies and uploads Rasputin into the experimental Exo frame, expelling Clovis I in the process, with Rasputin using his heuristics matrix to speak to the Guardian. Ana warns the Guardian that the instance of Clovis I in the H.E.L.M had relayed to the instance of himself on Europa that "they know," before Rasputin replaced him in the Exo frame. With his diagnostics completed, Rasputin thanks the Guardian for bringing him back and offers his favor in return by doing whatever he can to defend humanity from the forces of Xivu Arath. He needs time to come up with a plan of action, so he asks the Guardian to continue gathering more submind data in the meantime. 
3 January-14 February Battle of the War Gods Raaputin tasks the Guardian with recovering more submind data, but before they do, Osiris discovers that Rasputin's data caches contain information related to a location called "Nefele Stronghold", hinting of a city on Neptune: Neomuna. Upon recovering more submind data, Rasputin notes some changes in his personality and concludes that he and Xivu Arath are respectively humanity and the Hive's War Gods albeit with different motives. As they work to gather more submind data and aid Rasputin in his recovery, Mara discovers that by regaining control of the Warsat network and using it against Xivu Arath's army, they are falling into Xivu Arath's trap to facilitate her invasion of Earth. She relays this information to the leaders of the Coalition, a group of allies actively working to defend Sol from the forces of the Witness and its Disciples. She forms a plan to use Rasputin as bait to stop the ritual allowing Xivu Arath a foothold on Earth with Ana and the leaders of the Coalition nodding in agreement. Rasputin informs the Guardian that he needs time to form a plan to stop Xivu Arath's Wrathborn forces without using the Warsats and tells them to follow the Vanguard's instructions. After gathering enough submind data to complete his recovery, Rasputin tasks the Guardian with recovering classified data from a bunker in the Cosmodrome. Rasputin admits that he was ready to shoot down the Traveler during the Collapse before Ana convinced him to abort the firing sequence. After driving out the Eliksni breaching the bunker, they recover the classified data to be handed over to the Vanguard and return to Rasputin. He thanks them for the effort and discovers that he is more than a weapon by comparing the Guardian to his Seraph agents. He realizes that defending humanity was the best decision he ever made and that he and the Guardian will face the next threat together and prepare for the imminent arrival of the Witness in Sol. After weeks of combat simulations, Rasputin discovers that the only way to prevent Xivu Arath's invasion of Earth from coming to fruition would be to sacrifice himself. He informs the Guardian that Eramis has activated ABHORRENT IMPERATIVE, a protocol designed to shoot down the Traveler and prevent its departure, so they must upload him with the Pillory Engram in tow aboard the Seraph orbital station manually for his sacrifice to be successful. They defeat the combined forces of Eramis and Xivu Arath on the way there while the forces of Empress Caiatl assist the Guardian in Rasputin's plan. They confront Eramis at the hangar bay before she flees to complete the firing sequence at the command of the Witness, then goes to the orbital station bridge to defeat a powerful champion of Xivu Arath: Ir Garza, Scourge of Earth. The forces of the Coalition discover that the Traveler is leaving the Last City and Earth as a whole. Eramis attempts to complete the firing sequence, but Rasputin's sacrifice prevents it from completing; therefore, his sacrifice has not only destroyed all of the Warsats in orbit but also prevented Xivu Arath's ritual from invading Earth. The Witness tells Eramis that the Traveler has "nowhere left to run," giving out yet another clue of the Witness's plans for the Traveler as it arrives in Sol alongside the forces of Emperor Calus. The Vanguard learns that in the Traveler's absence, the forces of Coalition: the Guardians, Empress Caiatl's Cabal, Mithrax's House of Light, and the Awoken will unite and stop the threat of the Witness and its Disciples together. They then return to Ana who discovers her purpose, then the Exo Frame that once housed Rasputin before his sacrifice. He leaves a pre-recorded message confirming the existence of Neomuna and a mysterious paracausal force called "the Veil." The Guardian then begin making preparations for Neptune. 
Lightfall/Season of Defiance 
28 February The Invasion of Earth begins The Witness and its forces finally arrive at Earth's orbit to confront the Traveler. The forces of the Coalition respond to defend the Traveler, but the defense fails as Amanda Holliday and the other pilots go down in the fight. The Traveler shoots out a terraforming beam on the Pyramid the Witness was inhabiting, which the Witness is unphased by, stepping out into open space to approach the Traveler. Upon communing with the Traveler, the Witness discovers the location of the Veil somewhere on Neptune and instructs its new Disciple Emperor Calus to find it. Osiris learns of the discovery and follows the Cabal fleet traveling there. 
First Contact The Guardian follows Ikora's orders to pursue Osiris to Neptune's orbit. They fight the Shadow Legion: followers of Emperor Calus carrying Pyramid tech to shield their allies when killed. They are forced to use the different keycards to navigate the first Shadow Legion vessel, Vual Gaudium, and destroy its navigation computer. They fight a Tormentor for the first time, with Osiris replying that it is the result of Calus's ascension to one of the Disciples of the Witness. They finally destroy the navigation computer before they make their way to the other Shadow Legion vessel: Astaroth Rex II. The Guardian observes that Calus's flagship, Typhon Imperator, is making its way to Neptune's surface as Calus taunts them. Osiris informs of a plan to use Cabal Drop Pods to make their way to Neptune's surface. The Guardian scuttles the Cabal vessel by destroying its engines and makes their escape. Before they reach the Drop Pod launchers and rendezvous with Osiris, they confront the same Tormentor they'd seen earlier, Kavauust, Reverent of the Witness, killing it. They follow Osiris's instruction to board the Drop Pod and land on Neptune. They land in a city on Neptune: Neomuna, and meet the Cloud Striders Rohan and Nimbus. On the way to find Osiris, they discover a mysterious anomaly filled with Darkness energy. Using the anomaly, they become the first being to discover Strand, using them to defend Osiris from the Shadow Legion before eventually becoming exhausted. After defeating the last of the local forces, the Guardian and Osiris work with the Cloud Striders to repel an invasion force led by the Disciple Calus. They regroup at the Hall of Heroes and learn that Cloud Striders are warriors of Neomuna with a maximum of a 10-year lifespan, after which they succumb to their augmentations. Before beginning their work to locate the Veil, they meet Nimbus and retrieve a gift from Mara Sov. She reminds the Guardian that they are fighting a two-front war with the Shadow Legion; one front on Neptune and another front on Earth. With her message received, the Guardian leaves to find the location of the Veil. 
Under Siege The Cloud Striders relay the coordinates of the Veil to the Guardian, but the way there is blocked by Cabal shielding, so they are forced to defeat Shadow Guard enemies to retrieve keycards for Ghost to remove the shield. While they defend Ghost, they defeat an onslaught of Shadow Legion and Vex stopping their effort. Ghost finally removes the shield and allows the Guardian passage to the coordinates of the Veil. On arrival, Ghost notes a suppression field engulfing the area near the complex, so the Guardian is forced to defeat one of the Shadow Legion officers with their weapons: Vul'ourn, Shadow Legion Supply Master. They witness Shadow Legion Harvesters surrounding the plaza near the site of the Veil. The Witness possesses Ghost and contacts Calus to receive progress on finding the Veil, whilst inadvertently revealing their plans to establish a link between the Radial Mast and the Veil to the Guardian. They inform Nimbus and Osiris of the plans. 
Downfall The Cloud Striders and Osiris suggest the Guardian infiltrate Calus's flagship to find the Radial Mast and destroy it before it establishes a link with the Veil. Rohan warns the Guardian of Calus's forces guarding the Radial Mast before they enter the flagship. On the way, they see more Strand energy. They navigate the flagship by shooting shards to open doors, getting on grav lifts, and platforming. They reach a room containing Shadow Legion Threshers, so they destroy the hangar by depositing resonance into a totem. They then confront another Tormentor before proceeding. Finally, they reach an arena where the Radial Mast is secured, but a projection of Calus demands a test of the Guardian. They deposit the resonance on the totems and defeat some of the champions sent by Calus. They then use a recently discovered Strand font to defeat the Taken and Shadow Legion infesting the arena. They become exhausted again, and just as Calus's forces begin ambushing them, Empress Caiatl arrives to rescue them and helps them escape the flagship by following her Thresher via their Sparrow. The Empress warns them not to listen to Calus's words. Nimbus gives the Guardian their next objective. 
Breakneck Nimbus tasks the Guardian with restoring power to the CloudArk, a digital space the Neomuni inhabit to provide defense and infrastructure to Neomuna. They stop the Vex siphoning power and use Strand grappling points to navigate the reactor. They finally smash the Vex Mind in charge, Calixte, System Ward Finality and reboot the reactor providing power to the CloudArk. On their escape, Nimbus reveals to the Guardian that it was a trap set by the Shadow Legion, so the Guardian is forced to evacuate the reactor quickly using Strand. Back at the Hall of Heroes, Nimbus sees Osiris using Strand as well. Osiris reveals to Nimbus the true nature of Light and Darkness. Light is the force that deals with physical transformation; Darkness is the force that deals with memory. Nimbus gives Osiris advice to flow with the river when it comes to Strand. 
On The Verge Nimbus gives coordinates to the Guardian so Osiris can give them a new understanding of Strand. They interact with more Strand fonts and smash Vex along the way. Osiris encourages them to lean into using Strand rather than backing out of it and to go beyond their limits. They do so on the way and upon arriving at Maya's Retreat, they interact with a large Strand font and discover the first Aspect of their Strand subclass. They test their mastery of Strand concepts on the Inquisitor Mind, but they become exhausted before its defeat; Osiris encourages them to not give up and unleash their mastery on its defeat. Osiris congratulates the Guardian on being capable of using Strand without constraint, but has yet to figure out how to control Strand more effectively. Osiris meets the Poukas, semi-aquatic creatures capable of reflecting emotion onto its subject. Rohan and Osiris discuss the feeling of pain before they are interrupted by the commotion outside. They see the Radial Mast being transported in the direction of the Veil. 
No Time Left The Guardian and Rohan begin making their way to the Radial Mast's location as Nimbus and Osiris act as support. Osiris discovers that Strand is capable of destroying suppression fields scattered throughout the city, so the Guardian destroys them with Strand. Nimbus assists the Guardian by using Neomuni tech to replicate Drake Tanks used by the Vanguard after clearing out the LZ first. They do so and use the Drake Tank to bypass Shadow Legion Interceptors, Goliath Tanks, and Threshers blocking the way. They are forced to destroy more suppression fields and defeat an Imprint of Nezarec before they can rendezvous with Rohan. They meet him near an Ishtar Collective lab where the Radial Mast is located. They defend him as he finds a weak spot in the Radial Mast and defeats another Shadow Legion officer, Val Bho'kaurl. They become exhausted from using Strand before they can destroy the Radial Mast, so Rohan decides to sacrifice himself to destroy the Radial Mast. Nimbus asks the Guardian to bring Rohan's core to them. Meanwhile, Calus informs the Witness of the Radial Mast's destruction. The Witness then berates Calus on his lack of purpose before reminding him to secure the Veil so the Witness can create a link to it. 
HyperNet Current Nimbus notes a strange presence is detected within the CloudArk and then they and Caiatl task the Guardian with finding the source at the Vex Network. They defeat the Shadow Legion and a Tormentor named Toniq, Imprint of Nezarec guarding a Taken blight. They enter the Vex Domain and clear out Taken blights and rifts along the way. An unidentified voice claims the Vex Domain for itself, with Caiatl commenting on its similarities to the Nightmares they encountered in the Derelict Leviathan. They find Parthenios, Drifting Mind, a Taken Hydra and expel it from the Vex Domain. Caiatl instructs them to return to Neomuna to make final preparations to claim the Veil, but before they leave, the unidentified voice reveals itself to be Nezarec, another Disciple of the Witness now haunting the Neomuni. 
Headlong The Guardian forms a plan: Caiatl would rally the remaining Cabal at her side, Nimbus would reactivate the remaining CloudArk defenses throughout Neomuna, and Osiris would help them complete their understanding of Strand. On the way, they see the Shadow Legion preparing for a siege to uncover the Veil. They wield Strand from a different perspective and use that knowledge against the Vex. They interact with a large Strand font and discover the second Aspect of their Strand subclass. Upon mastery of the second Aspect, Osiris asks them to finish their training on the VexNet. They return to the Vex Domain and finish their proficiency of Strand by slaying the curator, Ioneion, System Control Flow. Phase 1 of their plan is complete, so they begin phase 2. 
Desperate Measures For phase 2 to proceed, they must destroy the AA turrets set up by the Shadow Legion before they go to the plaza to defend it. They use their weapons and abilities to defend themselves and the CloudArk turrets against Shadow Legion troops as well as Ishtar Collective ordnance to destroy Goliath Tanks. Empress Caiatl and her troops arrive to help the Guardian, therefore completing phase 2 of their plan. Phase 3 begins as the Shadow Legion continues its assault on the plaza. They and Caiatl are forced to defend the plaza on their own when the CloudArk turrets go down. The assault is on hold when a projection of Calus taunts Caiatl and blasts open the Veil Containment site. The Guardian navigates the abandoned Ishtar Collective lab before seeing the Veil themselves. Ghost becomes fascinated by the Veil's paracausal power being similar to the Traveler. As they continue exploring deeper in the lab, Caiatl informs them that Calus is on his way to their location for a final showdown, completing phase 3 of their plan. They confront Calus underneath the Veil and defeat him once and for all despite his powers as a Disciple of the Witness. Their victory is short-lived as the Witness possesses Ghost once again and establishes a link with the Veil. Ghost wonders what happened, to which Caiatl replies they lost. The Witness uses the Veil's power to create an incision on the Traveler and begins its plans for the Final Shape by entering the portal to the Pale Heart. 
The Aftermath The Guardian begins assisting the Neomuni in recovering from the war on Neomuna, from helping to track down Rohan's notes leading them into the Black Garden to assisting the Archivist in repairing Cloud Strider monuments damaged by the Vex. Despite the recovery efforts, the Neomuni would become haunted by nightmares, believing Nezarec to be responsible. The Guardian finally gains their mastery on Strand as they can now use it outside Neptune. 
28 February-28 March Operation: Prison Break The Guardian meets Mara Sov, Mithrax, and Devrim Kay at the Farm. Mara Sov explains that the gift from her will be paramount to their operation to rescue prisoners captured. They begin at the EDZ, where they follow Amanda Holliday's distress signal. They use the Ascendant Scepter to breach the Pyramid warding through the Ascendant Plane. Then, they defeat the warden in charge using the Ascendant Scepter's balefires before they rescue Amanda. On the way out, she accidentally shoots Crow, believing him to be of Shadow Legion. Crow dismisses the comment as they all leave the Pyramid outpost in the EDZ. The Guardian receives a transmission from Mara Sov at the War Table explaining the Awoken becoming the latest addition to the Coalition and the role of a Queensguard. She tasks them with rescuing more prisoners before she can coronate them as Queensguard. They complete the task and become Queensguard. They then receive a message from Holliday thanking them for their rescue and telling them that another Pyramid outpost is found, this time in the Cosmodrome. Upon arrival, Crow and Devrim note that the outpost is almost empty. They breach the warding using the Ascendant Scepter and enter it, but they are ambushed by Shadow Legion and Taken. The warden in charge uses its Psionic powers to banish the Guardian back to the Ascendant Plane. They overcome the warden's Psionic powers, defeat them, and rescue more prisoners. They call Devrim via holoprojector and learn from him that Mara has crowned him and Crow Queensguard as well. Mara then informs the Guardian that a Shadow Legion prison ship is in Earth's orbit, but it is impenetrable from the air, so they must use the Ascendant Scepter to breach its defenses. They learn that through their usage of balefires, they can open new Ley Line pathways. They use Ghost to hack the Shadow Legion security computer, then defeat the warden in charge of the orbital prison ship. Upon their success in freeing prisoners from the orbital prison, Amanda and Mithrax celebrate the occasion. Amanda reveals her journey to the Last City and the struggles of humanity. After the Guardian frees more prisoners, Amanda explains her reason for wanting to volunteer for the operation. She and Mithrax pick up a distress signal from a Shadow Legion prison base in the EDZ Tunnel, but they request assistance from the Guardian. They infiltrate the tunnels, destroy Shadow Legion heavy infantry, and defeat a Tormentor loyal to the Witness: Vereziia, Reverent of the Witness. Mithrax is able to free the prisoners, but Amanda is killed in the explosion. Zavala, Crow, Mara Sov, and Mithrax all grieve the loss of Amanda, with Crow seeking vengeance and Mithrax blaming himself for her death. Mara and Caiatl reassure him that Amanda chose to die in the explosion and to lay aside his guilt. 
7 March Acquisition of Vexcalibur The civilians of the EDZ begin seeing anomalies around the Gulch. The Guardian investigates the anomalies and follows the signal to a cave. Mithrax discovers a Vex signal leading to a blue-eyed Harpy beeping "Assistant" in Morse Code, implying Asher Mir is still present in the Vex Domain somewhere. They penetrate the Avalon domain without the help of the Splicer Gauntlet, much to Mithrax's surprise, and follow the signal. Mithrax learns that the local Vex and the Avalon domain are at odds with each other, all thanks to Asher Mir, who has been fighting to stay independent of the Vex Network. With direction from Asher, they slay Variant Stalker Brakion, Repurposed Mind. A hologram of Asher Mir then allows the Guardian to retrieve Vexcalibur, thanking them for freeing him from his pain. On subsequent returns to the Avalon domain, they learn more secrets Asher is revealing to them and Mithrax, using data from Specimen Mu, Specimen Iota, and Specimen Gamma, as well as the nature of the Pyramids as mediums. On another death of Brakion, Asher reveals that his research about the nature of the Pyramids holds knowledge about the Veil before he becomes fully subsumed by the Vex Network. 
10 March The Final God of Pain's Fall With Nezarec's influence continuing to haunt the Neomuni, the Guardians find him at the source: the terraformed Pyramid formerly inhabited by the Witness. They navigate the interior of the Pyramid, shattered by the accelerated growth of a Tree of Silver Wings within. Interacting with seeds of Light and Dark spread throughout the Pyramid, the Guardians begin the process of reviving Nezarec. They learn that they can combine the effects of both seeds to provide shelter against overwhelming energy periodically pulsating from Nezarec's sarcophagus. They reach an orrery and defeat Zo'aurc, Explicator of Planets, a Shadow Legion commander. After a short while following the Explicator's death, Nezarec's new body finishes regenerating and they confront the Guardians personally. Despite his usage of both Light and Dark, he succumbs to the Guardians, ending his influence on the Neomuni. Osiris declares they will find out where the Witness went through the portal based on the clues it has left behind inside its terraformed Pyramid. 
18 April Retribution Crow forms a plan for vengeance for the death of Amanda Holliday. The Guardian would infiltrate a Shadow Legion flagship hanging in Earth's orbit using the Ascendant Scepter while he, Devrim, and Mithrax would distract the forces occupying it. Crow detonates the charges set up in the hangar after the Guardian dispels the Pyramid beacons using balefires.

The Guardian uses powers sent by Mara Sov to destroy the cooling fans and scuttle the flagship by destroying its engines. They leave the flagship and see it blow up in the sky within the Farm. The forces of the Coalition celebrate their victory and honor the memory of Amanda. Crow informs them that the Awoken have fully committed to the causes of the Coalition alongside the House of Light, the Cabal loyal to Empress Caiatl, and the people of Neomuna, and bids them farewell for now as Devrim and Mithrax continue the operation to rescue the remaining prisoners captured by the Shadow Legion.

Season of the Deep 
23 May Recovery of Deputy Commander Sloane Upon repairing all of the Cloud Strider monuments damaged by the Vex on Neomuna, Soteria informs the Guardian that an enemy of the Witness is hiding somewhere on Titan. The Vanguard decides to pursue this lead as they have run out of options to follow the Witness inside the portal it created using the Veil's energy. Zavala organizes a rescue team upon receiving a distress signal from none other than Deputy Commander Sloane. He selects himself, Saladin, Saint-14, and the Guardian to partake in the mission to find the source of Sloane's distress signal. As they continue exploring the derelict rig on Titan, Xivu Arath announces her presence by sending in Taken and Hive forces to hamper the rescue team's efforts to find Sloane. The Drifter arrives on Titan's orbit via the Derelict to assist the rescue team. After pushing back Xivu Arath's forces and aligning the communications array, Zavala traces the signal to Kraken Mare. They attempt to dive into the methane sea, but the pressure tries to kill them. The Difter provides them a prototype diving gear to overcome the methane sea pressure. Zavala follows the Guardian to the source of the signal and the both of them reunite with Sloane. She reveals the Taken corruption inhabiting her body and introduces them to a sea monster named Ahsa. She tells them that Ahsa is an ally who holds vital information about the Witness, and gives them diving gear from the Golden Age to replace the ones provided by the Drifter. Sloane and the Drifter explain the mission: for Ahsa to reveal everything she knows about the Witness, they must first extract Egregore samples from the depths of Kraken Mare so she can then form a psychic connection with Sloane. They go to recover Golden Age tech from the New Pacific Arcology before working with Sloane to hunt a Wrathborn Servitor and extract the first set of Egregore samples. Sloane explains more about her Taken corruption being used to eavesdrop on enemy communications before she tells the Guardian she needs time to recover before she's ready to form another psychic connection with Ahsa. 
30 May-13 June Deep Dives Zavala debriefs Sloane on the events that have occured since Titan was captured by the Witness, from SavathÃ»n disguising herself as Osiris to the formation of an alliance between the Vanguard, the Awoken, the Cabal Empire led by Empress Caiatl, and the Eliksni House of Light, from Guardians using the powers of Darkness to the appearance of the Lucent Brood, and from the discovery of Neomuna to the deaths of Reed-7 and her closest friend Amanda Holliday. After the debrief concludes, they continue the mission to extract more Egregore samples so Ahsa can provide more intel on the Witness. Xivu Arath psychically attacks Sloane as they dive deeper and confront Kudazad, Bound to Xivu Arath and Kelgorath, Taken from Bones, who are stopping the Guardian from recovering the next set of Egregore samples needed to form a connection with Ahsa. They learn from her that the Witness's species was once blessed by the Traveler's Light, confirming one of SavathÃ»n's statements on the origins of the Witness. They also learn more about the first conflict between Light and Darkness and the Witness's plan to seek the Final Shape. 
20 June The Witness unveiled After some time extracting the coral and then using it to form a psychic connection with Ahsa, she is finally able to explain the origins of the Witness. She explains that the Witness is a gestalt of the first civilization uplifted by the Traveler, made manifest through Darkness. She also reveals that the Final Shape is the Witness's plan to reshape the universe to its liking by connecting the Veil to the Traveler, just as it had done earlier by using Ghost. She warns them that the Final Shape will be apocalyptic before disconnecting from Sloane. Sloane is shocked at the recent events on Titan and loses faith in her mission in some way before dismissing them. After gaining intel on the Witness, Xivu Arath's forces attack Ahsa and forcibly begin a ritual to Take her. The Guardian travels with Zavala, Sloane, Saladin, and Saint-14 to stop the ritual in the depths of Kraken Mare as Drifter provides tactical support. With assistance from Saladin's Iron War Beasts, the team can defeat the Wizards conducting the rituals and free Ahsa. They return to the site where Sloane forms a psychic connection with Ahsa, but as she forms the connection one last time, Xivu Arath corrupts Sloane's body. Zavala's encouraging words stop Xivu Arath from completely robbing Sloane of her free will. Ahsa reveals that SavathÃ»n, the Witch Queen, possesses the instructions to follow the Witness inside the portal. The necessity to bring back SavathÃ»n angers both Saladin and Saint-14, but Zavala reassures them that the Hidden will contain the situation. Before leaving the H.E.L.M., Zavala reminds the Guardian to bring hope to those who don't have it. They brief Sloane, who informs them that the mission is complete and she'll stay on Titan to keep an eye on Ahsa, who is now resting from the psychic connections she had to endure. 
The Lucent Ritual After Xivu Arath pulls her forces out of Titan, the Lucent Brood crash-lands their ship underneath the Arcology and begins a ritual to resurrect Oryx. Sloane advises the Guardian to discover and put an end to the ritual, but she is unable to provide further instructions due to the ritual interfering with their comms. They navigate the methane sea and the Lucent Hive wreckage. There, they see a champion of Oryx resurrected into the Lucent Brood: Ecthar, the Shield of SavathÃ»n. After defeating him and then crushing his Ghost, they navigate the wreckage further and discover the ritual site being orchestrated by Å immumah ur-Nokru, a Lucent Necromancer attempting to have a Hive Ghost resurrect the Taken King. They were able to put an end to the ritual, restoring the comms between them and Sloane. She requests the Hidden to secure Oryx's remains. Chalco Yong, Lisbon-13, and Fenchurch Everis are the members selected to extract Oryx's remains from Titan. They send a report to Ikora regarding a terrifying revelation: Oryx is still alive despite the lack of his Worm symbiote and he remembers Xivu Arath's presence as explained through the calcified fragments scattered throughout the Arcology and beyond. 
4 July Acquisition of Wicked Implement Xivu Arath allows the Guardian access into her temple underneath Kraken Mare after they recovered and deposited broken blades into 3 different statues. The Guardian would defeat the Taken Knight Khull, Executioner Knight and the Tormentor Omen, Blade of the Black Terrace. After tithing the death to Xivu Arath, she would deem them worthy of wielding the Wicked Implement so they could continue to tithe to her. 
23 May-28 November Veil Containment Meanwhile on Neomuna, Osiris and Nimbus learn about the Veil through logs left behind by Dr. Chioma Esi, an Ishtar Collective scientist and one of the founders. It is revealed that her wife, Maya Sundaresh, is attempting to use the Veil to replicate what happened with the Witness when its civilization merged into itself using Darkness and with Calus's experiments with the Scorn aboard the Glykon. Out of shame, Chioma sends Lakshmi-2 to Earth and orders the Veil Containment site to be shut down forever.

They stop Xivu Arath from allowing tribute to be fed to her. As a result, she sends in her greatest champion to test the Guardian's combat capabilities: the Leviathan-Eater, Bane of the Ammonites and harbinger of the Hive God of War. The Knight withdraws from combat after seeing the Guardian's strength over it. As Eris looks for a way to defeat Xivu Arath, they participate in SavathÃ»n's experiments with the Light by attuning to the energies of Arc, Solar, and Void.

Immaru complies and resurrects the Witch Queen. SavathÃ»n flies over to Eris, complimenting her Hive Form, Eris kills SavathÃ»n and gains all of her power, as SavathÃ»n had not been killed since she lost her worm, making Eris the most powerful Hive to ever live.

14 November The 15th Wish Due to SavathÃ»n leaving one last gift, the Guardian returns to the Imbaru Engine and discovers three braziers. They find the flames at the Imbaru Engine, Altars of Summoning, and SavathÃ»n's Spire, lighting the braziers to reveal the final test. Completing the test opens a door leading to a room with a pure Ahamkara egg belonging to Riven's clutch, uncorrupted by Taken energy. Ikora orders them to bring the egg to the Athenaeum.

Season of the Wish/Into the Light 
28 November Riven returns The Guardian returns to the Dreaming City as the Witness sends the Sol Divisive to invade it and hamper their efforts to bypass the portal into the Pale Heart while it begins to enact the Final Shape. The Guardian visits Riven's corpse and recovers an Ahamkara tooth so the Techeuns can conjure the spirit of Riven, and attempt to uncover the 15th wish. Riven refuses to grant the 15th wish until she tasks the Guardian with recovering her clutch. Riven accuses Mara of scattering her clutch when the Guardian enters her lair and discovers that it is missing from its physical location. The Techeuns would use the Ley Lines to locate the clutch. After recovering the first of her clutch, Riven reveals the relationship between her species and the Awoken before tasking them with clearing out her lair while the Techeuns locate the remaining eggs. Osiris would also look into an alternative solution should Riven be tricky via the Veil. 
5 December The next egg recovered The Techeuns would finally locate the second of her clutch; however, Petra informs the Guardian that it will be more difficult to locate and recover the remaining eggs without the help of the Harbingers: mysterious entities that were once used in the Battle of Saturn. Petra tasks them with recovering a Starlight Lodestone from the Chamber of Starlight to guide the Harbinger to the clutch still scattered. Before returning to Riven, Osiris would provide an update on the Veil and his attempts to replicate the Witness's link to it through the Guardian's Ghost. 
Secrets in the EDZ Crow discovers a Scorn presence in the EDZ and provides their last known location to the Hidden. The Guardian follows the clues to a snowy mountain containing a Dark Age castle. They defeat Rathil, First Broken Knight of Fikrul, but a Chimera bearing the avatar of Hefnd places them in jail. They break free from jail and continues their pursuit until they are forced to confront the Locus of Wailing Grief and defeat it. They reach the summit of the mountain and defeat the Chimera. After the Chimera is defeated, Crow and Petra would begin uncovering the story of Hefnd and its relationship with Naeem as the Guardian collects Hefnd's bones. The truth is finally revealed to them once the Guardian enters Hefnd's Cairn. They would present their finds to Ikora. 
12 December The 3rd egg recovered Before the Harbinger can track the next egg, they must allow the Techeuns to attune the Starlight Lodestone to it by participating in the Coil, then returning to the Spine of Keres to calibrate the Lodestone. As they recover the next egg, Riven begins taunting Crow on his role in creating the Scorn when he was Uldren Sov. They finally recover the egg and witness a conversation between him and Mara. Osiris informs the Guardian that with his progress on his attempt to replicate the Witness's link to the Veil being very slow, the Ahamkara are the only solution to follow the Witness inside the portal. 
19 December Starcrossed The Sol Divisive continues their invasion of the Dreaming City by creating an Axis Mind capable of simulating the Techeuns and deploying Oracles from the Vault of Glass into Riven's lair, which are mimicking resonance used by the Witness and its Disciples. The Guardian arrives to collect the next egg. Unfortunately, they would arrive too late, as the Sol Divisive manages to steal the egg and then transport it into the Black Garden, near Taranis's corpse. The theft of the egg angers Riven, but Osiris assures her that the egg can still be recovered. Crow discovers that the egg is inside the Black Garden, so he sends the Guardian to recover it using Riven's accessway. They would use the sparks left behind by Riven and another Ahamkara to navigate the Black Garden and defeat the Axis Mind. After the Guardian finally recover the egg, Riven learns that Taranis is responsible for scattering the clutch, used as his final wish at the cost of death. Riven explains the relationship between her and Taranis before the Great Ahamkara Hunt, when they were separated. The Guardian returns to Riven, who instructs them to honor Taranis's memory by keeping Wish-Keeper. They would uncover her messages in the Black Garden and the Dreaming City by forming constellations with Wish-Keeper. They learn the truth after finding all the celestial anomalies: they find a symbol of the Ishtar Collective with Vex architecture 
26 December The 5th egg recovered Riven instructs the Guardian to stop the Taken attempting to corrupt the next egg they will soon recover. The Guardian defeats a Taken Knight once loyal to Xivu Arath, but learns that the Taken have succeeded in their plan to corrupt the egg. Mara proposes a solution to cleanse it of its corruption: they would first acquire Taken essentia by completing an Ascendant Challenge, then allow the whim to feed on their desires. With egg cleansed, they return to Riven, who is in a conversation with Mara and Osiris. She reveals that the 15th wish would allow only one individual to enter the Pale Heart via the Ley Lines. Mara becomes furious at Riven for withholding the information, but Osiris stops her with Strand, and the both of them leave. Osiris concludes his investigations into the Veil and reveals that one more egg must be recovered before Riven can grant the 15th wish. 
2 January-9 January The final egg recovered The Techeuns have found the location of the final egg, but they must first reactivate the Oracle Engine by destroying Sol Divisive Oracles. Before they go to recover the final egg, Crow shares his plans with Mara, Osiris, and the Guardian: he volunteers to be the first Guardian to enter the Pale Heart via the Ley Lines. After recovering all of the eggs, they return to the Wall of Wishes to enter the 15th and final wish. It is successful, but Riven suffers the same fate as Taranis. Mara informs them that once Crow and Osiris form the bridge that allows the Coalition a safe passage through the portal, they will finally be able to confront the Witness before it can complete the Final Shape. 
9 April Defense on the Last City As the Vanguard waits for Crow and Osiris to form the bridge needed to enter the Pale Heart, the Witness responds to their attempt to follow it by sending in its Hive and House of Salvation forces to attack the Last City. The Vanguard forms a counterattack by giving Shaxx permission to bring back weapons once deemed heretical in the form of the BRAVE Arsenal as the threat of the Final Shape looms over the Sol System. He and Arcite 99-40 sets up shop in the Hall of Champions to form a plan to stop the Witnessâ€™s forces until they hear from Crow in his status. 
21 May Closer to the Heart Osiris uncovers a plot by the Sol Divisive to replace the Veil with the Black Heart, which was recreated as the Witness's final attempt to keep them out of the Pale Heart. He instructs the Guardian to return to the Black Garden using the passageway provided by Riven and stop the interference preventing Crow from entering the Pale Heart. They would destroy Transfer Gates throughout the Black Garden and destroy the Withdrawn Mind before returning to the site where they first found the Black Heart. They destroy it by defeating the Established Mind, Synchronal Mind, and Inevitable Mind. Destroying the Black Heart allows Crow entry into the Pale Heart. He meets Cayde-6 after seeing the Witnessâ€™s monolith in the horizon and duel for a short time. The duel ends when Glint reveals himself to Cayde-6. After helping Crow get up, they both see Light pulsing from the monolith. Osiris reveals that Crow has made it through the portal successfully and the Vanguard plans to accompany them once he is able to replicate the Witness's link to the Veil. 
The Final Shape 
4 June The Final Shape Approaches The Witness begins to enact the Final Shape on the people of the Last City. Just as it proclaims victory, the Traveler resists the Witnessâ€™s efforts and undoes the calcification. After Mara reveals that they are running out of time to stop the Witness's plan from becoming a reality, the Vanguard initiates Operation Ahamkara and travels through the portal with the Guardian in tow, becoming separated from each other in the process. 
Transmigration The Guardian crash-lands inside the Threshold, a bridge between the Pale Heart and the Sol System. The area manifests as a memory of the Dreadnaught and the European Dead Zone. They fight through the Taken forces sent by the Witness to stop them. They also learn that the Dread are created by the Witness as its personal enforcers including the Tormentors they faced earlier upon being confronted by modified Psion units called Weavers that use Strand to pull their target toward it. They would use their mastery of Light and Darkness to create a path forward. After being confronted by enemies with an unbreakable shield, the Witness soon learns of their presence and Mara's connection to the portal. Before she forcefully cuts the connection, she informs them that the Coalition will defend the Last City in the Vanguard's absence. They were able to enter the Pale Heart successfully as they experience a vision sent by the Traveler. They soon enter the Lost City, a location manifesting the memory of the Tower prior to its destruction in the Red War. As they follow a hawk of Light, they meet aerial units of the Dread called Grims, capable of inflicting tinnitus if their target gets too close. They then discover Prismatic, a fusion of Light and Darkness energy capable of breaking through the unbreakable shields through Transcendence. Ghost detects a Vanguard signal once his Guardian was able to acquire the full power of Prismatic. Unbeknownst to them, the signal was used by the Witness to ambush them with Taken and Dread forces including a Harbinger Subjugator named Vrihn, Subjugator of Gardens. After defeating the Subjugator, they reunite with Cayde-6, who was expecting Crow instead. 
Temptation Cayde-6 reveals that Crow has scouted ahead, but he has not returned since, so Cayde-6 tasks the Guardian with finding him. They travel to the Landing, a location manifesting the memory of the Last City itself. They fight through the Shadow Legion and Attendants, modified Psion units that use Stasis to slow their target. They were able to track down Crow through Glint, who reveals that Crow is trapped in a cave created by the Witness as an incision. Glint helps the Guardian by tasking them with turning off the resonant dials in the area around the Landing connected psionically through the Taken Psions. Along the way, they face an Omen Subjugator. After turning off the dials, then defeating the Pillar of Denial, they enter the Refraction, a location manifesting the memory of the Dreaming City and defeat the Dread forces blocking the path to follow Crow. Glint reveals that the hawk serves as way for the Traveler to ask the Guardian for help. After entering the cave, the Witness speaks through Ghost before he shuts it out completely. Nonetheless, the Witness explains its attempt to offer Crow dominion of the Reef by using both Light and Darkness to depict dioramas throughout the cave, but Crow has refused. They were able to find Crow listening to the whispers of the veiled statues, which were used to imprison the minds of the Penitent who disagreed with the Witness's pursuit of the Final Shape. He is chastised by Glint to never leave his side again. Crow agrees, and they establish camp outside the cave. Crow explains his experience within the cave to Cayde, before they learn that Ikora has survived. Before the Guardian leaves the makeshift camp, they intercept a transmission from Mara. She explains that she is gathering the Coalition leaders to follow the group into the portal. 
Exegesis The Guardian leaves the camp and makes their way forward to find Ikora, fighting Hive forces along the way and using the Aegis to create Light motes and their weapons to create Darkness motes. Before they are able to get a view of the crash site, they are confronted by Husks, melee units of the Dread that unleashes a Geist unless their belly was shot. After clearing away the corruption spreading inside, they were able to locate the crash site. Ikora reveals that she is found in the Blooming, a location manifesting the memory of the Cradle on Io before the moon was abducted by the Witness. They defeat the Pillar of Silence and regroup with Ikora, who is in deep meditation. They defend her from the Dread forces attempting to corrupt the Tree of Silver Wings and break her out of meditation. She explains the Final Shape in more detail and how the Witness was able change the Traveler by introducing Darkness to it. The group convenes in a camp near the tree, where Cayde reunites with Ikora there. 
Requiem Realizing that Zavala is missing, the Guardian gets to work on locating him by removing a seal blocking the passage to the Seclusion, a location manifesting the memory of Zavala and Safiyah's house during the Dark Age. After fighting through House Salvation and Dread forces, they enter another cave created by the Witness. This time, it depicts the dioramas of Zavala's unending grief. After leaving the cave, they regroup with Zavala and help him defend the homestead from House Salvation forces by defeating the Pillar of Stillness. Once it is defeated, Zavala finally lets go of his unending grief, accidentally discovering one of the Witness's dissenters crying out for help. Ikora breaks Zavala from his trance before they both regroup at camp with Cayde and Crow outside the house. They contemplate about loss before Cayde's advice to let go strengthens their resolve. 
Ascent The Guardian follows Crow and Cayde to the Divide, a location manifesting the memory of the Cosmodrome wall. As they ascend the mountain, Ghost begins to hear the Traveler screaming for help as the Witness attempts to spread corruption through the landscape. Crow finally reveals the truth to Cayde: he was brought back through a wish Crow unintentionally made to Riven before he made it through the portal. Cayde instructs Crow to keep his real reason to return a secret. The Guardian fights through Sol Divisive and Taken forces before they enter the Impasse, a location manifesting the memory of the site where Ghost found his Guardian on the eve of the Darkness's return. They follow the hawk to a large fissure of Light, where the Guardian was born in the Sol System and the Traveler gifts them new Supers to aid its chosen champion in the fight towards the monolith. After using new powers against the Taken, they establish camp nearby. 
The Message After the Guardian was able to acquire new Supers directly by the Traveler, Cayde suggests that they open a line of communication with the Traveler. They follow the coordinates provided by Glint, but they arrive too late as the Witness begins to spread its influence further, and to make matters worse they discover a Lucent Brood presence in the Pale Heart. After tracking down the last set of coordinates provided by Glint, they find an unlikely ally assisting them: Luzaku. She was sent by SavathÃ»n to infiltrate a Black Fleet vessel and make their presence known inside the Pale Heart. They were finally to arrive before the Witness was able to corrupt a fissure, and then Cayde and Crow rendezvous with the Guardian to commune with the Traveler. Through a vision, it invokes the Guardian tenets and when asked by Cayde if he wants to stay with Sundance, it offers him to make his own fate before the Witness cuts the vision short by showing him the forgotten part of the Guardian tenet: death. 
Liminality Zavala reveals that a Tormentor is blocking a path to the monolith and instructs them to slay it. They enter the Abscess, a location manifesting the memory of the home planet of the Witness's precursor species. They use Taken energy to invoke Ahamkara skulls to clear the lava-like fluid. The Tormentor escapes, but they were able to uncover a secret about the Witnessâ€™s past. After another dissenter reveals a solution to defeat the Witness by "giving in to Darkness," Ikora and Zavala argue before Cayde reminds them of the task ahead. They defeat the Tormentor named Kataxiia, Tormentor of the Ahamkara, and establish camp nearby. At camp, Zavala lashes out at Crow and begins to lose faith in the Traveler, leaving camp by himself. 
Dissent Targe accompanies the Guardian on their mission to pursue Zavala by entering the Transgression and following the Darkness path left by the dissenters. They fight through a howling sandstorm and Scorn forces as the dissenters finally reveal the veiled statue's true nature. They follow the path into the Maelstrom, a temple complex constructed by the Witness. They defeat the Pillar of Devotion, escape the temple, and find Zavala outside. He ignores Ikora's warning and enters a pool of Darkness. The Witness shows Zavala a vision of the precursor species' home planet and their search for purpose. Then, it shows him the moment the Traveler left the home planet after recovering the Veil from deep space. Finally, it shows him how the Penitent faction used the powers from the Veil to create itself. It attempts to offer Zavala to join its side, but Targe stops him. The Witness crushes Targe, causing Zavala to become mortal. Back at camp, Ikora and Cayde comfort Zavala as he succumbs to despair over the loss of Targe before Ikora slips a clue necessary to defeat the Witness: "What was made can be unmade." Before leaving camp one last time, Ghost instructs the Guardian to travel to the Sacrarium, a location manifesting the memory of the site where the Penitent used the Veil to create the Witness. 
Iconoclasm The group begins to make their way to the ritual site with the Guardian leading the charge. The Witness notices their progress and tempts them to become a Disciple by depicting more dioramas of what the Guardian could be, but they refuse. As they continue their ascent towards the ritual site, Mara was finally able to enter the Pale Heart through the H.E.L.M. and tracks them down. They enter a chamber depicting a diorama of the Hall of Guardians. Ghost sees through the trick the Witness is attempting to use on the Guardian. It reacts to the Guardian's rejection with anger and instructs them to meet it in combat within the ritual site. The Witness attacks them with powerful Darkness abilities and sends in 2 powerful Subjugators to defend it. After destroying the first Subjugator, the Traveler gives its chosen champion a sword of Light before they enter the Witnessâ€™s mind where the dissenters instruct them to destroy the statues with the sword. It works, wounding the Witness in the process. After defeating the second Subjugator and then destroying another statue, the Vanguard arrives to stall its forces long enough for the Guardian to destroy yet another statue. The Witness gravely wounds the Guardian and their Ghost, forcing them to retreat. They successfully escape within the H.E.L.M. before Mara arrives to pick up Crow and the Vanguard as well. 
Queens, Part I While the Guardian and the Vanguard were making their way towards the monolith, Mara recruits Empress Caiatl, Mithrax, and Micah-10 of the Six Coyotes to oversee a solution to heal the Traveler and prepare the Guardian for their assault on the monolith. The Coalition establishes a base of operations in the Lost City before the Guardian begins their work to prepare. Crow discover a plot by the Lucent Brood to attack the base on two fronts. The Guardian pursues one front while Crow pursues the other. They discover that SavathÃ»n had used the diversion to bait the Guardian to test their mettle against her. She has her forces retreat. Mara instructs Crow to aid the Vanguard while she and the Guardian deals with SavathÃ»n. 
The Hollow The House of Salvation, led by Korha, the Hollow, begins their attempt to extract paracausal energy from the Tree of Silver Wings inside the Blooming. The Guardian teams up with Mithrax to stop the House of Salvation's plans. After destroying the machines by using the opposing polarity, Mithrax discovers his connection with Korha. He flees from the tree, but the Hidden were able to track him down to Europa. As the Guardian and Mithrax pursue Korha inside Riis-Reborn, he reveals that Korha was responsible for the death of his mother, Inaaks, when Korha served under the House of Winter. They finally corner him in the Technocrat's Iron before he is killed by a House of Light Brig. Mithrax was finally able to avenge his mother through the death of Korha. 
Home The Vanguard receives intel from Crow that the Shadow Legion have deployed Light-harvesting machines throughout the Pale Heart. The Guardian teams up with Empress Caiatl to sabotage the Light-harvesting machines. The Shadow Legion anticipates the machine's destruction inside the Transgression and would attempt to conceal their operations by using the snow-covered mountains within the Divide as cover. Unfortunately for the Shadow Legion, the Guardian and Caiatl would expose the operation anyways, and uncover the heart of the operation within the Seclusion. After destroying the Goliath tank and destroying the final Light-harvesting machine, Caiatl offers Zavala advice to let go of the past. 
Queens, Part II Mara discovers that she is able to see hidden fissures of Light, she requires Taken energy to be able to see them. SavathÃ»n and Mara continue their sparring as the Guardian continues their work to uncover the hidden fissures of Light. After uncovering the fissures, the Taken begins to ambush the Guardian, but Luzaku has arrived to assist them in their fight against the Taken. They uncover the final set of fissures hidden in the material plane and reveal them. Mara demands that SavathÃ»n's Lucent Brood form a temporary truce with the Coalition and aid in the fight against the Witness when the time comes. 
Wild Card The Guardian works with Cayde and Crow to investigate the Witness's experiments with Dark Ether. While the investigation continues, Cayde and Crow bond over their roles as a Hunter before they discover that the Dark Ether canister has been stolen. They continue pushing back the Witness's forces as the Hunters track down the location of the Dark Ether canister. They were able to track it into a Screeb-infested cave within the Transgression. They confront Lil'liks, Harvester of the Witness and recover the canister. Cause and Crow were able to kill the Abomination with a cave-in and return to the makeshift camp in the Landing. Cayde passes down the cloak of the Hunter Vanguard to Crow. Cayde reveals that he is not planning to return to the Tower, and Zavala begins to learn Stasis. 
Acquisition of Ergo Sum After the Guardian was able to disrupt the plans to corrupt the Pale Heart any further, they fuse Light and Darkness into a Dyadic Prism, return to the site where they first confronted the Witness and acquire one final gift from the Traveler: a sword from the Corridors of Time that was found on their grave. With the weapon acquired, they are finally ready to begin their assault on the monolith. 
The Guardian would begin to work with Micah-10 to locate unpartered Ghosts and bring them into the Pale Heart to help the Traveler heal. They would be sent to find Peach at the Cosmodrome in Old Russia. Upon arriving at the location, Micah learns from Shaw Han that Peach was asking questions about the Hive nest inhabited by Omnigul and later NavÃ´ta. Furthermore Micah also revealed that Shaw had spotted Lucent Hive scouts a few weeks ago. Fighting their way through hordes of Hive, the Guardian returns to the Lunar Complex and slays the newly returned, NavÃ´ta. With NavÃ´ta's resurgence, Micah hypothesizes that it could be an imposter masked by SavathÃ»n to infiltrate Xivu Arath's ranks, or she was resurrected through the act of Necromancy. Nontheless, Ghost picks up Peach's Light signal, allowing them to find her and bring her into the Pale Heart. 
Beginning their search for the Ghost, Link who was previously located at the Ocean of Storms on the Moon, the Guardian delves info the Hellmouth.

Locating Bean's signal on Nessus, the Guardian is sent by Micah into the Insight Terminus. Advancing towards the Insight Terminus, the Guardian astonishingly discovers a clone of Kargen, the Technocrat. Pursuing him into the Insight Terminus, the Guardian slays the Psion Flayer to discover that he was attempting to tap into the Vex Network to retrieve data about the OXA Machine, the Psion prediction machine that was able to see the future in branching paths, and the Sol Divisive's research on the Veil. They would uncover that this Cabal detachment were receiving orders from Otzot, a leader of the Psion Conclave. This would lead to them to believe that there were defecting branches in the Shadow Legion, and the Psion rebels siding with the Witness were just creating a deception to cover there operations. Furthermore, they also learn that Kargen's attempts at stealing data from the Vex Network were stopped by Maya Sundaresh. The Guardian finds Bean at the Pools of Luminance and then bring him to the Pale Heart. 
The Guardian is sent to the Dreaming City by Micah-10 to search for Akasha, a Ghost scanning Awoken territory. Fighting there way through Taken and Scorn forces, the Guardian follows her signal into the Ascendant Plane. They learn that Akasha had been analyzing the Ley Lines due to Xivu Arath moving her forces across the Ascendant Plane en masse as the God of War had now abandoned her loyalty to the Witness and was preparing for the next war to come. Finding Akasha within the Confluence, the Guardian accompanys her back to the Pale Heart. 
Arriving on Mars at Micah's request, the Guardian begins their search for Citrine, a Ghost with a heavy interest in Warmind technology. Fighting there way through Hive forces of Xivu Arath at the BrayTech Futurescape, which had been caught into a time rift, the Guardian defeats a manifestation of Kelgorath. Due to the time wound bleeding out, Mara would task her Techeuns with sealing it away, even if only temporarily. The Guardian then finds Citrine who had made it safely to the Enclave and bring her to the Pale Heart. Citrine would apologize to Micah for her late arrival, however she would try to hide that she had attempted to strip the Warmind Bunker for parts. 
Micah sends the Guardian to locate Anwar, who began to seek out the truth of the Darkness after the death of the Speaker. Entering into the Europan Pyramid, the Guardian defeats a Cabal force sent by Oztot while Micah would ask Cayde questions about his memories about his time on Europa. Shortly after communing with a statue to a dissenter of the Witness, Micwh unfortunately learns that Anwar had perished. Retrieving his remains from the Ziggurat, the Guardian brings them to the Pale Heart for Micah. Speaking with Micah at the holoprojector, she reveals that she met Cayde on Europa where they developed a friendship over cards that would help her process her emotions and transgender identity. 
The Guardian is sent to search for Heilung, who had previously been sent on a long-term recon operation within the Court of SavathÃ»n, but had ultimately lost contact with over a year ago. Returning to the Temple of the Cunning, the Guardian defeats the Ahamkara Illusion once again before finding Heilung at the Sanctum of the Brood Queen. Arriving to the Pale Heart, Heilung would assist the Traveler in healing and provide the intelligence on the Lucent Brood she had gathered. 
Micah would receive telemetric data about the Ghost, Balthazar and discover he was on the Moon. Tracking his signal into the Lunar Pyramid, the Guardian enters within, while Ghost remarks that the Pyramid appears to be longing with the absence of its master. Vanquishing the Nightmares of Ghaul, Fikrul, and Crota within, the Guardian uncovers an Archival Sphere that Balthazar was looking for due to the information it possessed: including an ancient recording where the Witness ordered Nezarec to show the Psions the power of the Veil. After receiving the sphere, the Guardian finds Balthazar and brings him to the Pale Heart. 
As the Guardian speaks with Micah at the holoprojector, she warns them that the Witness is approaching the final shape. She then sends them to find Hecate, who was investigating a rumour of members of the House of Dusk moving into the old House of Devils territory. Infiltrating the Devils' Lair, the Guardian, encounters House Salvation Brigs that were not flying the House's colours. Furthermore, Micah detects a House Salvation ketch despite the fact that their forces should have rallied within the Pale Heart to assist the Witness. Eventually the Guardian infiltrated the fortress and destroys a copy of Sepiks Prime, with Cayde recognizing some of the slain Fallen as former members of the House of Wolves. These regulations would imply that House Dusk was offering Eramis a Prime Servitor in exchange for weapons. They would also deduce that Eramis was more Ether starved than the Dusk refugees and that she had abandoned the cause of the Witness, but House Dusk had another Prime Servitor or another source of Ether. Finding Hecate at the place they were resurrected, the Guardian escorts her to the Pale Heart before speaking with Micah, who orders them to prepare for the battle against the Witness.. 
7 June Salvation's Edge The Guardian recruits a fireteam of six and begins their assault on the monolith to stop the Witness from acquiring the Travelerâ€™s Light and completing its vision of the Final Shape. They would empower an alien machine by feeding the conductor a pyramidal resonance, a spherical resonance, or a hexahedral resonance while transferring power from one plate to another and back. They would also deposit leftover resonance in a box. While inside the monolith, they would fight through Sol Divisive, Taken, Shadow Legion, Scorn, Hive, and Dread forces along the way. After defeating the Herald of Finality, the Witness reveals that it is the first knife wielded by the enigmatic Winnower, confirming the texts within Unveiling. Once they reach the summit of the monolith, they face the Witness in a completely different form. Using their mastery of paracausal forces, they were able to weaken the Witness and completely stop the Final Shape from being enacted, giving the Coalition an opportunity to strike the Witness before it could regain its strength. 
Excision With the Witness weakened, Zavala rallies the Coalition and the Lucent Brood to strike at it one last time. They face its remaining forces and open the way to the Witness. They would receive a variety of Relic weapons to assist in the final assault against the Witness. To weaken the Witness further, they destroy the remaining statues of the dissenters, and as it defends itself with a glass barrier, Ghost asks his Guardian to channel the Travelerâ€™s Light directly through him. The Witness is finally defeated, ending the war against the Witness. Ghost would become completely drained of the Light. Cayde offers to sacrifice himself by transferring his Light into Ghost. The people of the Last City celebrate their victory over the Witness by releasing paper lanterns into the sky.
